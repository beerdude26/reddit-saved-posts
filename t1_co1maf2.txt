Yes. And they, very conveniently, priced themselves so that unless you need more than, say, 35,000 pages, their "offer" won't be of much use.

Oh, and lest we forget, *all*, and I do mean **ALL** standardization work is covered by the corporations that send their employees to committee meetings - having paid for their time, transportation and per diems. The standards "organizations" are basically bureaucrats who reap huge profits and provide what amounts to a meeting space, a secretary or two, and some web servers. It's fucked up. The professional orgs like IEEE, ASME and IEEE are a bit less offensive here, but IEC and ISO are essentially full-on, no-holds-barred parasites. To a large extent the national standards bodies are, too.

So as not to be all negative, ITU is a knight in a shining armor in comparison, with IIRC 95%+ standards being completely free to access. And they do have a lot of good standards that can be reused when you do anything communications-wise. Heck, say what you want about X.25 - it's still nice if you don't want a TCP/IP stack on a microcontroller.

Another thing worth noting: many, many standards adopted by cheaper-cost-of-living nations are available for much less from their national standards bodies. I've got a lot from Romania, Slovenia, etc. India is wonderful since under national laws it makes any nationally-adopted *safety* standards free - you can get them from [resource.org](https://law.resource.org). Some of those *are* IEC or ISO standards - for example the functional safety 61131-3 standard, etc.

Yet another thing: *any* standards that are made a part of public US law by reference *automatically* become exempt from copyright protection and their distribution is free. A *lot* of those have already been made available by resource.org, for example [those standards referenced by CFR](https://law.resource.org/pub/us/cfr/manifest.us.html). This is where **I love** the U.S. lawmaking on the matter so far: it makes it unequivocal - it's law, it's copyright-exempt. Anyone who still pays for NEC or building codes is getting shafted. The European lawmakers are **ass fucking backwards** in this matter.
