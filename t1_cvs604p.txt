For anyone who hasn't, please do watch the Ghibli films (in Japanese preferably). Especially Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Kiki's Delivery Service, the original Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind (technically not a Ghibli film), Grave of the Fireflies and Howl's Moving Castle.

edit: And of course, My Neighbor Totoro.
