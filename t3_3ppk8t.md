I want to learn type theory. Hopefully something relatively comprehensive, hopefully something that covers dependant types and so on.

I am NOT looking to learn practical type theory, I've already used Haskell for a long time now, I'm looking to further my understanding and abilities and I've determined this is the best way for me.

I currently have "Type Theory and Formal Proof" by Rob Nederpelt and Herman Geuvers. This seems like a good book, and it is certainly comprehensive. I was wondering what other books people had good experiences with?
