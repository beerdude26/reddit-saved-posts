Check out World at War
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_at_War

Greatest documentary ever made about the war. It was made in the 70's, so a lot of the armies high command were still alive, so lots of interviews with people pulling the levers, and also the civilians affected by it all.. It's an incredible chronicling from start to finish, for those that have never seen/heard of this.
