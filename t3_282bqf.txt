I'm taking a break from filming the Goosebumps movie to hang with you and answer your questions. This will be a themed Q&amp;A, so please prepare spooky questions only. Just kidding, normal questions are also welcome.
 
I'm also helping to support an awesome cause - Tonasket Water Ranch and Pool Project. Donate and you could win a trip to hang out with me on the set of Goosebumps and see your childhood nightmares come to life. Plus we'll take selfies! Enter here: http://www.omaze.com/JackBlack
 
And nowâ€¦ask me anything!

I gotta run. Thanks for joining me today, all my friends and family and fans. Check me out on http://www.omaze.com/JackBlack. Much love. J out!
