Very cool.  If the author is reading this, I would suggest taking a look at what Chris Smith did with [Haskell for Kids](https://cdsmith.wordpress.com/2011/08/16/haskell-for-kids-week-1/).  It's a great way to approach the math in a really tangible way.  Now, a few years down the line he has improved the infrastructure a bit and it is available at [codeworld.info](http://codeworld.info/).
