I've been hearing about S.T.A.L.K.E.R. so much lately its insane, usually S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is compared so many times on games like the fallout series and Metro series. But honestly I want to hear what made the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series so great and how it affected the gaming world.

Also could you convenience me to actually play the game? I've seen gameplay of it and honestly it does look a lot like the metro series, but it doesn't look like something I'd personally play. 

edit : wow everyone, thank you all for your input. I was expecting maybe 50 comments at most, but apparently this blew up because you guys are either about as curious as I am or die hard fans of the franchise as well. After reading some of the comments. [I think my first playthrough will be with the oculus rift though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2GlRkS9fxw) *note not my video* 

according to some posts, the AI are apparently shiet in this game so I'll try to find a great AI enhancement mod. This doesn't really look that scary just watching videos. But that's also what I said about some other games in the past like outlast. :L

I appricate every comment you guys included and will be checking out the series. It looks like a fantastic series, and a very challenging game based off of objectives.
