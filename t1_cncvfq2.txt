A squirrel is living in a pine tree.  One day he feels it shaking, looks down, and sees an elephant climbing the tree. 

The squirrel asks: "What are you doing climbing my tree?"

"Well, I'm coming up here to eat some pears," says the elephant.

"You idiot, this is a pine tree, there are no pears."

"Well I brought my own pears."
