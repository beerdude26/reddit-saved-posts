My friend did this to me once and I've done it before to randoms. 

Basically he walked into an elevator I was on and pretended he hadnt seen me in a long time. I went with it. The fun was we would start making shit up: "so you still dating Bruce and on that veggie free diet?" its funny cause we would keep trying to 1up each other and the people would give us strange looks as they thought it was legit

every now and then we do the same to random people, pretending we know them from some party and make up an embarrassing story
