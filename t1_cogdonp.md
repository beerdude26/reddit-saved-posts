How large do you need the application to be? My largest one, [hawk](https://github.com/gelisam/hawk), is 3 KLOC and I have some good stories to tell about the way its code is organized.

*edit*:
Wait, that can't be right, only 3 KLOC? My [ludum dare game](http://github.com/gelisam/ludum-dare-31) is almost 2 KLOC, and I've only spent 48 hours on it!

Speaking of which, I have good stories about how that code is organized too.
