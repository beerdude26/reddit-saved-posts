I just discovered the `is` library on hackage, and for the right problem domain, it's a very handy tool. It just does TH generation to make functions like `isRed`, `isGreen`, `isBlue` (for some data type Color with the constructors Red, Green, and Blue). I was wondering if anyone knows of a more comprehensive library that offers the same feature.
