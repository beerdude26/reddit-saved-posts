Have a look at [yesod-bin](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/blob/master/yesod-bin/main.hs#L156) that offers you a development server with `yesod devel` [that rebuilds when files change](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/blob/master/yesod-bin/Devel.hs#L240) (among other things).  It [uses GHC as a library](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/blob/master/yesod-bin/GhcBuild.hs) as [abac321 mentioned](http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/229e6k/how_does_automatic_code_reloading_in_haskell_web/cgkm2qw).
