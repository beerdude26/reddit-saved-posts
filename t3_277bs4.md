Edit: Thanks for all the ideas everybody! Whenever I get bored this summer I'll come back to this for sure.

Edit 2: Drugs and orgies. That's what my summer is looking like right now.

Edit 3: Well thanks for all of the (quirky, weird, stupid, genius, illegal) ideas, it's been a pleasure reading all of these and WILL implement (some of) them in my summer schedule.
