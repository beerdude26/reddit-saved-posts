title: What are some real world uses of Writer?

I'm new to Haskell and have learned about Functor, Applicative, Monad. I'm now looking at some Monads that I see mentioned from time to time. I think I get that Reader can be useful for passing configuration throughout an application. When I look at Writer, though, I can only think of toy examples where it might be useful..stuff like doing some computations and sort of logging what's happening as that proceeds. 

I'd like to get a better sense of when/why to reach for Writer in my code. Can someone give an example of a real world use case?
