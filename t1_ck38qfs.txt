I think that one of the cases in Oliver Sacks' book The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat discusses this. It was an older woman who developed the disorder later in life. It mentioned how she would eat exactly half of her plate of food, and be confused as to why she was still hungry. She eventually learned to rotate her plate if she found she wasn't full yet.

If you find this thread interesting, I would highly recommend that book. It's really interesting and not a difficult read.
