I was talking to a psychology professor today about current issues in America which eventually led to media coverage. As we spoke about how poorly the media often goes about reporting stories and how much "power" the media holds in reporting breaking news, elections, and modern social and scientific issues I wondered, and asked; why don't academics get more involved in public debate over social and natural science issues?

Why are the "experts" that news outlets often consult and ask for input on-air not PhDs and research professors at top universities? His answers to this made sense: the incentive system is not set up that way, often times academics go about answering questions in ways that simply aren't interesting or are too difficult to explain to the public, and it is sometimes even frowned upon for an "academic" to engage in public discourse. 

While this makes sense it left me wondering - why does it have to be this way? Could it ever be different? How would it work?

What if the president had his PhD in economics, sociology, social psychology, or political science? What if positions were given based off of educational/research experience and not popularity or connections? Well, he said, more intelligent people aren't necessarily more moral people. We went on to agree, however, that although they may not be more ethical and moral, they would certainly go about making changes in a more rational, logical, or hopefully evidence based manor. Something that I think we could all benefit from. 

But, how could a system like this possibly exist and also be democratic? How could lay people possibly be expected to have enough knowledge to elect such experts when they differ and debate in such complex, nuanced, and technical ways? Additionally, how could society ever hope to progress successfully and efficiently as issues, especially in regards to the sciences, become so much more complex? 

I am left enthralled by the idea of a technocracy. Could something like this ever possibly come to reality? Could it possibly work? What would be potential problems with a technocratic system? Lastly, are their any political scientists today that write/research about technocracies that I could read?

Thank You
