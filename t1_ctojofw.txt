Mort is the first in the Death series, so to speak, and a great place to start.

[Use a reading guide like this](http://i.imgur.com/CrfabVt.jpg)

You'll see that Mort is first, then Reaper Man, Soul Music, Hogfather, and Thief of Time. ([source](http://www.lspace.org/books/reading-order-guides))

I'd also highly recommend Guards! Guards!, the first book that introduces you to the characters of The Watch.  Their books are some of my absolute favorites.
