This made me laugh.  He's running StableBit DrivePool, which shows your 'pool of disks' as all of their space combined... but within the settings, you are able to set duplication by folder or entire data set and how many file duplicates you want.  

To be honest - Its the best RAID setup I've ever had and ditched my numerous Hardware / Software RAID 1, 1+0 and 6 setups I've had.  I feel a lot safer running it than any sort of Dell / PERC / Intel RAID.
