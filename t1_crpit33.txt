Former line cook here, try this on for size.

&gt;hot pan

&gt;olive oil in

&gt;garlic, shallot in
 
&gt;brown

&gt;add white wine, let it reduce

&gt;add heavy cream, let reduce

&gt;add parm (i use a parm/mozz mix)

&gt;add basil oregano and a teensy bit of sugar

It'll blow your mind, the white wine makes the sauce
