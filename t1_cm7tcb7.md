Thats not moral, that is mainly expediency. 

People often further their own interests at the expense of someone else, sometimes at the expense of a whole society. Nothing moral about that. Likewise, people often fight to gain a monopoly, or to dominate an industry, or a society. It may help them, and may harm everyone else. So furthering your own interests is neither moral, not immoral, its purely amoral.

Its how you do it, and what you are trying to achieve, which determine morality.

You "owe" the other guy whatever you can convince them to accept.  If he is willing to do the deal for 10 cents, then you determine whether you think you are getting a good deal or not. 

If someone is starving, and you have a loaf of bread, do you sell it for the price you brought it for ($1.00) or for the price the starving person is desperate to pay (e.g. $1000).

The moral response, is to sell it for the price you paid for it. The capitalistic response, is to sell it for the maximum you can get away with. And if a starving person is willing to pay $1000 for  $1.00 loaf of bread, then capitalism encourages you to take it.

In most cases capitalism encourages ***immoral*** behavior.

And the only thing that guards against it getting out of control, is some form of regulation, strongly enforced, to limit the abuses that greed, monopolies etc, tend to aim for.
