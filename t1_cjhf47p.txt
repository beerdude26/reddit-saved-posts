With a witty joke. The aim is to get the audiences attention, and there's no better way to get them listening than to make them laugh. A favourite of mine is:  
  
"Sorry I'm late. I was trying to make a belt out of wrist-watches. It was a complete waste of time."  
  
This will get them thinking, (hopefully) laughing, and you'll have them in the palm of your hand.  
  
Good luck!
