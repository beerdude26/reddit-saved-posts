DOCUMENTATION! Seriously, our documentation is abysmal. Yes, I know you're supposed to "read the types", but that only tells you the *what*, not the *why* or *how*.

And the lack of non-Haddock documentation (e.g. in-depth tutorials/examples) is even worse. Haddock should be for documenting the API functions/types; complete Haddock documentation doesn't even begin to approach good documentation.

I'm not blaming anyone in particular - this is a failure by all of us, as a community; we implicitly foster the culture of minimal documentation. We need to change that!

So please - if you want to give back to the community, rather than trying to implement new features in your favourite library, first think: Could the documentation be better?

[We as a community need to realise that API documentation is fundamentally the library's UX, and should treat it with the same attention we put on other UX's.](http://blog.parse.com/learn/engineering/designing-great-api-docs/)
