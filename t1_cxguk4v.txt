One problem is point 2 above. Error messages are not abstract. I think a lot could be done there.

Personally, I think a tool like stack could provide a `--confused ` option where statistics on programmer confusion could be gathered centrally. If a confusing error is encountered often, let's some expert provide guidance. In an industrial setting, saving 5 minutes of confusion here and there can make or break whether a tool is with its weight.
