As a suggestion for site search, there is [Hunt](https://github.com/hunt-framework/hunt ), A lightweight search-framework written in Haskell. It is used in Hayoo. I will discuss a first release with the original auhtors next Wednesday. 

There is Elasticsearch for one, but having a Haskell-page-search written in Haskell sounds awesome.
