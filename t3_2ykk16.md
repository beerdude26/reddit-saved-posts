Dear Haskell reddit community, I'm in the process of convincing IBM management to evaluate Haskell as a language for building IBM cloud services. I have anecdotal evidence that there are other companies profiting from building infrastructure in Haskell and using functional approaches; i.e., Facebook ([React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/02/18/react-conf-roundup-2015.html), [Hack](https://code.facebook.com/posts/264544830379293/hack-a-new-programming-language-for-hhvm/), Haxl and the [new job postings](http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/2useoq/haskell_opportunities_at_facebook/)), Standard Chartered ([Don's 2015 talk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9CJGKvXP0UhLVRUamNFMnBZdzg/view?usp=sharing)), and [Jane Street Capital](https://www.janestreet.com/technology/). However, I'm lacking numbers relating the work of the Haskell teams to that of the teams using other languages (Java, C++, Python, OCaml, Scala, and F#). 

- Do you have concrete numbers relating the team output?
- Do you have numbers that quantify the difficulty of training or hiring Haskell developers?
- Do you know where I could find such numbers to make a convincing case?

I also greatly appreciate pointers and arguments that help me make a better, more objective case.
