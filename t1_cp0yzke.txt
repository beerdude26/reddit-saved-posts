It's also one of the best chick flicks of all time.  It was such a good chick flick, you didn't even notice it was a chick flick.  You thought it was an action movie, and you loved it.  

Here's the plot of aliens, in terms of how events relate to the protagonist:

A single mother, Lt. Ellen Ripley, returns home from work to realize that her baby has died. (that is, lived her whole life and died of old age without any children of her own while Ripley was in cryosleep)

Having "lost" her "child", Ripley becomes clinically depressed, and lounges around in her underwear, not eating, not bathing, and smoking cigarettes, until Carter Burke offers her the opportunity to take revenge against the species that, in a roundabout sorta way, cost her her baby.

Ripley puts on her big-girl panties and decides to take him up on his offer, figuring it's the only way to shake off the depression.

On LV-426, Ripley encounters a recently orphaned girl, about the same age as Ripley's kid when Ripley originally shipped out on the Nostromo.  Ripley attempts to bond with the girl, but finds her initial attempts rebuffed.

Bla bla bla a bunch of marines die figuring out that all the colonists are dead or cocooned and they have to get themselves, Ripley, and this girl, Newt-- the lone surviving colonist --the hell off of LV-426 because there are xenos everywhere.

During this, Ripley discovers there is another mother with whom she is in direct conflict: the hive queen.  

During a xenomorph assault, Newt is caught or possibly killed, and Ripley decides to go after her.  In the moment where she believes Newt dead, we see all of Ripley's repressed grief and pain come crashing to the surface, until she hears Newt scream.  In saving Newt, she and Queenie share a moment, one mother to another.  She stumbles in on the xenomorph queen laying eggs and using nothing but body language, Ripley seems to say "I just want to take my baby and get out of here.  And I will kill your babies if I have to to do it."  Queenie understands the message loud and clear, and orders her praetorians to stand down and let Ripley go.  As a pair of facehuggers start to hatch, Ripley is reminded of what Queenie's children have already cost her: friends, colleagues and even her own daughter.

So Ripley sets fire to the entire nest, and shoots Queenie right in the babymaker with grenades, not only killing all of her current brood, but *permanently sterilizing her and denying her any and all future babies.*

Queenie, enraged, chases Ripley down but is unable to prevent her escape.  Back on the Sulaco, Queenie, who had stowed away, eliminates the last crewman, Bishop, and once again threatens to kill Newt.  

After donning a power loader, Ripley and Queenie engage in **the best Lifetime Network chick-flick catfight in cinematic history**, culminating in Queenie being blown out the airlock, left to die in the hard vacuum of space, childless and alone.

Having proved her loyalty as a surrogate mother and sheer unkillability, Newt rewards grieving mom Ripley with the only thing Ripley has really been wanting since the beginning of the movie: she throws her arms around Ripley and, still delirious from the pants-shitting terror of almost getting killed by a 20 foot tall xenomorph queen and then blown out of an airlock, she calls Ripley "mommy".

And Ellen Ripley learns that, as much as she believed she wanted revenge, her broken heart could really only start to heal by the love of a child.

ROLL CREDITS.

Edit:  Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!
