I'll attempt to put it succinctly. Not interested in writing a boring wall of text. Sorry if it's still long; 

Centrally-planned economies didn't suffer as much as we like to think from communism. The creation of the USSR led to the fastest industrialization of a large country since Germany in the late 19th century. They suffered from external factors like the rest of us (people love to talk about the Holodomor), but their economic doctrine still enabled them to become an industrial superpower in the next 60 years despite having to rebuild their industrial base after the devastating WW2 (from which the USSR suffered the most casualties in the world), and despite having a particularly unforgiving geography.
During that time, most of their peoples were housed properly (thanks to massive residential projects which were, I agree, kinda ugly), transported properly, and reasonably fed, and life expectancy increased. 

We can't say the same about the US during the periods in which they came as close as possible to being a libertarian heaven; the late 19th century, which gave rise to the progressive era because of how much of a shit-hole the country's cities had become. The average worker lived in absolutely squalid conditions, was fed toxic "food", and died extremely young. 

But that's just one example, and it's from a while ago. **Current** libertarian heavens in Africa and Asia, where government regulation of industry is extremely low, still suffer from the same dynamics as the US during the late 19th century. Workers being crammed in tiny housing, suffering from constant industrial accidents and pollution. Private security enforcing violent control policies over their workers, etc. These places are fucking shit-holes, despite receiving private investment from all over the world. You can compare with contemporary Cuba, which despite having a fairly depressed economy (partly due to the embargo that might end soon), still offers a pretty good quality of life to its citizens.

Although this may all sound like a "human interest" argument, it's actually not; investment patterns don't emerge out of nowhere, and no reasonable industrialist will invest in a new firm if demand for its products won't materialize. When your workers make shit wages and work 16 hours a day, don't expect them to buy your products. On a sidenote, this is why it was so hard for the US to rebound from both 1929 and 2007; government intervention not aimed at maintaining aggregate demand actually prevents industrialists from investing (no matter what they say). This creates a pretty intense rigidity in any country's industrial base. 

It's basic common sense but you won't hear a libertarian talk about it because most of them are useful idiots. If you're an entrepreneur and you know 50% of your population has little purchasing power because of wage deregulation or an economic downturn (sometimes both), there's a ton of business ventures you won't delve into. It doesn't matter if your production cost just got reduced because of lowered wages, the whole economy just shifted into survival mode. And that's why you see businesses working in retail ram up their prices in a downturn. People have been talking about the rising costs of food in the last 6 years (it had started a bit earlier than that but the trend continued despite output remaining constant), despite aggregate demand still being pretty low. Well that's why; only a few industries can benefit from a massive downturn. Most don't, and won't invest at all. This makes for a pretty inefficient economy.

This is why you still have the coal industry blowing up the Appalachians with mountain-top removal mining, and why it took so much time for the US to invest in solar despite having crazy potential for it. Entrenched private interests are shit for an economy.

The basic difference between these two extreme economic systems is that centrally-planned economies prioritize output over everything else, while libertarian economies prioritize profits over everything else. The thing is that output only has value if it's used by the most people possible; it's hard to justify an economic doctrine like this if people don't actually use the resources produced, because they go to waste. The libertarian doctrine has no such consideration because profits can be "stored" in the coffer of a minuscule proportion of the total population. So you see less incentives to promote technological growth in libertarian heavens than in centrally-planned economies. 

PS: Man this looks like a god-damned rant. The topic is so complex and it's late so I have to say I could have summarized it better. Sorry. I can get you some sources if you want.
