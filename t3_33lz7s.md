Hello fellow Haskellers,

I'm a CompSci student from Belgium and picked up Haskell about half a year ago in a course on declarative programming languages. Since then, I got really interested in the language and started attending the User Group meetings at my university. Struggling with the concepts there, I decided to restart my learning from zero.

I found the tutorial of [bitemyapp](https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell) on GitHub and I am working my way through it. I feel lucky I have read LYAH and had lectures of my own, but I feel that for someone without those extra's, picking up knowledge and experience from the reading material there can be quite a hard task.

Therefor I decided to put all my solutions to the homeworks online (on my [GitHub](https://github.com/MichielDeCuyper/Haskell)) together with a ReadMe explaining the thought process behind the exercises. 

My question now has 2 parts. First off, are there any legal problems with this? I'm re-using other people's material, although I credit them (for now it's just Brent Yorgey, but everything I learn, every exercise I make will be on there).  
Secondly I'm open to criticism. What do you think of my coding and writing style? You can read a first mini-tutorial at CIS 194/Homework 1. (I have to finish that tutorial and rewrite a few parts of my code to match the tutorial. Also, should I document my code or would the ReadMe be enough?)

Thanks in advance
