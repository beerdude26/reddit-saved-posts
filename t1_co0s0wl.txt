Please for the love of whatever you like. Do not paint this as "Cultural bullshit" 

Muslims and Apologists will just latch on to that and say this kind of behavior is not Islamic and True Muslims â„¢ will not do such a thing. 

No this is very much Islamic and it is what Muslims do.

To say this is a cultural thing is an insult to actual cultures. No I would not kill my own daughter because she got pregnant. I'm a civilized Arab not a Muslim. A culture that wants death is not a culture. It is a death cult.
