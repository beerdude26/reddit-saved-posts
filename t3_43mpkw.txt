I want to try out and or learn some sort of professional grade NMS to manage network devices. I feel like after getting a CCNA R+S, and the NA Sec certification, having some hands on with an NMS would definitely get me more readied for network admin position. What NMS is the best for a homelab environment of a couple switches, router, and servers?

EDIT: Sounds like Nagios is the way to go
