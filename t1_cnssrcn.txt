I'm not the one who created this list, but I thought this was worth mentioning. All credit goes to /u/rugtoad and his comment http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/22ooxm/hey_reddit_what_are_some_useful_keyboard_shotcuts/cgows8y

&gt; **General**
&gt; 
&gt; ALT+TAB: This is now the equivalent of knowing what the "enter" key does. You should certainly have a good handle on it if you are in front of a computer for more than 5 minutes on any given day.
&gt; 
&gt; WIN+TAB: On Aero themes, it's ALT+TAB on steroids
&gt; 
&gt; ALT+ESC: Quickly minimize what you're looking at. Great for when the boss sneaks up on you while you're browsing gonewild or something. Bonus is that it doesn't give the telltale "blip" on the screen of ALT+TAB that any boss worth his salt will recognize.
&gt; 
&gt;ALT-F4: An easter egg will pop up after you've given this command. (Thanks /u/Brassbeat)
&gt;

&gt; [List of GMAIL Shortcuts](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594?hl=en)
&gt; 
&gt; And of course...reddit keyboard [nav](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/wiki/index.php?title=Hotkeys) , available if you have [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; If there's any interest in more "esoteric" shortcuts...such as for things like VS or SSMS, then I might be inclined to share that knowledge as well. For now, though, I have to go and apply said knowledge before I get my ass fired...
&gt; 
&gt; **Visual Studio** (2012, maybe a few others)
&gt; 
&gt; Note: VS is a little more customize-able than the others on this list. These are the default bindings, but you can easily adjust them in the Options
&gt; 
&gt; CTRL+ALT+O or N: Open or Create VS Project
&gt; 
&gt; SHIFT+ALT+O or N: Open or Create Website project
&gt; 
&gt; CTRL+SHIFT+A: Add new item
&gt; 
&gt; SHIFT+ALT+A: Add Existing Item
&gt; 
&gt; CTRL+SHIFT+S: Save all of the things
&gt; 
&gt; CTRL+SHIFT+W: View the current webpage object in your browser.
&gt; 
&gt; F5: Start Debugging
&gt; 
&gt; CTRL+F5: Start without going into the debugger
&gt; 
&gt; CTRL+SHIFT+B: Build solution
&gt; 
&gt; F11: Step Into
&gt; 
&gt; F10: Step Over
&gt; 
&gt; SHIFT+F11: Step Out
&gt; 
&gt; CTRL+SHIFT+F5: Restart Debugging
&gt; 
&gt; F12: Go To Definition (You can also CTRL+Click)
&gt; 
&gt; CTRL+F12: Go to declaration
&gt; 
&gt; CTRL+Up/Down arrow: In a code window, this shifts the window without moving your cursor. Love this one.
&gt; 
&gt; ALT+Up/Down: Move line of code (this might be a part of Productivity Power Tools...I can't remember if it was integrated in VS2012, prior to that it's definitely PPT only though)
&gt; 
&gt; CTRL+X: If you do this without highlighting anything, it will cut the entire line. Same applies to CTRL+C. 1.CTRL+SHIFT+V: Cycle through the clipboard ring. Again, I love this one. If you are moving parts of code to different places and don't want to switch back and forth, just copy each one individually, then use this to pull them up.
&gt; 
&gt; CTRL+I: Incremental search. This is like a mini-find function. Press it and start typing, it will go to the next instance of what you are looking for. Press it again, and it goes to the next one. It's a little less "overhead" than CTRL+F, especially pre-2012.
&gt; 
&gt; CTRL+K, C: Comment selected line(s)
&gt; 
&gt; CTRL+K, U: Uncomment selected line(s)
&gt; 
&gt; CTRL+ALT+L: Go to the solution explorer
&gt; 
&gt; F4: Properties Window
&gt; A
&gt; LT+SHIFT+ENTER: Toggle Full ScreenCTRL+ALT+X: Toolbox
