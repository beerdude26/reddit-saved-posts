It is such an interesting story! The counterfeited notes that the prisoners created are considered among the best ever made and the Nazi government planned to dump them all in the uk to destabilize their economy. Even though this plan didn't work, they still forged over 100million pounds and used the money to buy supplies and things. Even as late as 1959, the Bank of England still knew there were lots of counterfeited note in circulation that they couldn't detect, causing them to recall all notes over 5pounds and then reissue bank notes in a variety of colors. The concentration camp is called Sachsenhausen and is outside Berlin. Very very interesting story!!
