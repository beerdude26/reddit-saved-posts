In 2006 Joel Spolsky [published a blog post in which he derived Map Reduce in Javascript](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/01.html).  It was simple, elegant, and mind-blowing to anyone not already aware of 1) how Map Reduce works, or 2) how expressive Javascript is, or 3) how functional programming provides new ways of thinking and problem solving.

Does anyone know if there is anything similar for Haskell, or more generally for Category Theory, of which Haskell is essentially a programming language implementation?  I'm looking to introduce a skeptical team of low-level hardware/C/crypto (and recently Go) hackers to Haskell, ideally with a similarly simple, elegant, mind-expanding demonstration of Haskell's capabilities.  Any and all ideas appreciated.
