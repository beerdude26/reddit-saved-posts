The Others has the most perfectly executed twist of any movie in my opinion. It's shocking, but it's also the perfect way to turn a movie on its head.  You have a pretty engaging horror/suspense movie with an interesting plot, and then after the twist you can immediately watch the movie again and see an entirely different story, equally engaging and even more terrifying.
