Makes me happy youtube exists,

[Frame of Essence](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQHsMwcGoH1ygyi-pJs5Z8A) talks about a lot of higher science like quantum mechanics. I love his video on how a quantum computer [really works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoT82NDpcvQ).

[CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w) is awesome, he talks a lot about how the world works, very fun to watch. I personally love his video on [the placebo effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2hO4_UEe-4).

[Historia Civilis](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv_vLHiWVBh_FR9vbeuiY-A) makes a ton of videos on the roman empire. His video on [roman battle tactics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iz1_UwD2Fw) is really a good watch.

[Brave Wilderness](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6E2mP01ZLH_kbAyeazCNdg) is probably my favorite animal channel on youtube that I have discovered so far. Their videos are really fun and educational to watch. I especially like their video on [snapping turtles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRrWiW1o19E)

[Great Scott!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6mIxFTvXkWQVEHPsEdflzQ) makes a ton of videos on electrical engineering. A ton of tutorials and stuff over there. [I like the videos he does on the LED cubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX1GaPgSheI).

[Atom Central](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_0Bl1X6Fnt2vKr-XUGS4WA) has a ton of stock nuclear footage, their videos are always a treat. I found their video on the [Castle Bravo nuclear test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2I66dHbSRA) to be breathtaking.

Also if your into conspiracies/aliens/monsters, [Suspect Sky](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdrSjQ5ztEGin2BTlisfJ3w) has got a ton of great videos/movies. Also [SuspiciousObservers](https://www.youtube.com/user/Suspicious0bservers) who makes an almost daily analysis on the world. While kind of niche, I really like both their channels.

Nothing will ever be a replacement for Discovery, History, etc. But these guys come damn close, if not above the quality of those channels back in the day.

EDIT: These are just my favorites, I'm sure there are other awesome channels out there that I just haven't found yet.
