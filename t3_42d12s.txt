Hi Folks. I was pointed in your direction from the kind folks in /r/sysadmin. 

I'm looking to set up an open source or free solution to do real time network monitoring on my home network. Ideally it would be a dashboard with all devices on the network and would display their usage / status. Another nice addition would for it do display some sort of alert when a device that is not recognized joins my network (or tries to). I have been tinkering with Spiceworks and Splunk, but figured I would run it by you fine folks before I put a lot of time and energy into figuring this out. Thanks in advance for any ideas. Cheers.
