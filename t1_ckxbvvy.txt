To finish - 


What is the purpose of controlling everything? What is the theorised goal of the people in charge at the moment? History repeats itself. It is the same goal that every previous conqueror has had. One government. One Nation. One Currency. One New World Order. This is the height of what EVERY person who’s ambition is to conquer and control the free world has had, through-out the history of humanity. 


And people have virtually achieved it before, though each time it has collapsed on itself. Ghangis Khan, Alexander the great… The Roman Empire, The British Empire. Each great conqueror or group has attempted to enact it through force and then maintain it through different models of control. This is what is happening now. This time, the conquering is being done in a new way. Through individual state/government corruption. Through privatisation. Through anonymity. Through multinational corporations that are owned by another corporation and another and another etc etc so that no one is ever to blame. 


Conquerors have learned that if you are a figure head, your head eventually becomes a target and is chopped off. That’s the purpose of the 2 party system. You get sick of one head you remove it and another one steps in. The process repeats over and over again, each time having the people believe THIS TIME things will be different. The illusion of freedom. The illusion of choice.



Civil Liberties. We are watching our civil liberties evaporate under the guise of protecting us from a foreign enemy. This is a control mechanism used by the state, the concept of perpetual enemies. A justification for a need of the state to exist and to allow it to continually exercise and expand its powers. Read or watch 1984 by George Orwell. This book is an allegory attempting to warn the public of the future if we do not become aware of what is happening NOW.

“Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.” Benjamin Franklin

It wasn’t so long ago the idea of the government listening into all of your phone calls was considered a silly conspiracy theory that was shouted out by tin foil hat wearing crazies. Lets explore what the government has the power to do openly through legislation and what is currently being done in secret (which is known due to the whistle-blower’s like snowden and wiki leaks).

Arrest without charge

Indefinite detention of any foreign citizen or national citizen 

Torture whilst in custody	


Public &amp; Covert Propaganda


False Flag Attacks

Execution without judicial process

Warrantless monitoring and access to ALL data that exists within the world on you from any governing body or private organization. 

This includes your every location with gps in your phone. Every transaction on your bank accounts. Every phone call and text. Every email. If you have a fly buys card or rewards card, every purchase of product you have made. Every illness or incident within the medical system. Every private legal interaction with a lawyer. Complete access to your computer through built in software &amp; HARDWARE backdoors including through encryption.

If a person told you that 10 years ago you would have called him crazy. Now this is just LAW. We are seeing this slow progressive conditioning to the people to accept this level of invasion into our personal lives so that the next generation just think this is NORMAL. This is the most dangerous thing any “Free” society can ever do to itself. 

What happens if you find out the government doesn’t work for you and now considers YOU the enemy. All it takes is one slip, one “Threat” to declare an expansion of these laws onto you and I and then we are left in a position where it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to take your liberties back from a government that no longer represents your interests.

I’m not trying to scare you, that couldn’t be farther from the truth. I’m doing what I think is right instead of becoming aware of injustice and doing nothing. I’m trying to help you question your surroundings. To question the path we are on. To question the system you were born into. All it takes to start a positive change in the world is awareness. If enough of us gain a fundamental understanding of some of the destructive and dangerous sociological mechanics we are witnessing in the world, we can fix the problems NOW. Real change is possible. It’s just a choice you have to make. 


I highly recommend watching some documentaries about these phenomena and to begin your own research into global, social and economic affairs. There are endless articles, films and blogs talking about these issues.

**NOTE** This one particular source has some information which has no sources itself, given the nature of accumulating history on a group of people who’s main objective has been to remain in obscurity, I can understand why. Be a critical thinker, decide for yourself whether that fits your understanding.





END NOTE: 

If you are looking for somewhere to go with your own path after reading this. I suggest modifying your face book feed to start incorporating news articles from independent journalists. I suggest you look around on reddit a bit more at some alternate news subs like endlesswar and wikileaks. Yes places like /r/conspiracy have their fair share of shit articles, but they have some real eye opening gems as well. Want to get off the internet for a while? Read 1984 and Animal Farm by George Orwell or Brave New World by Aldous Huxley.




Articles or interviews with Glenn Greenwald, and Noam Chomsky are also a great start. If your looking for a laugh after reading something this heavy, you need to look at the works of Bill Hicks and George Carlin. 




Finally, when confronted with this information I often get asked, “Wtf do I do now that I know all this”. 

I get asked this question every time i share this view point. I definitely think revolution is necessary. The system is inherently flawed and exploitable by psychopaths and negative human nature.



I am not a socialist or communist or democratic person. I think humans haven't quite got a system that is in balance with nature quite figure out yet. Watch zeitgeist, they go into a concept of a resource based economy, which i definitely am sold on being the only logical way forward. Every other system so far has fallen out of equilibrium with the environment. I think in zeitgeist 2 and 3 they go into it.


Revolution needs to be done peacefully. There’s a few great John Lennon quotes that come to mind 
"When it gets down to having to use violence, then you are playing the system’s game. The establishment will irritate you – pull your beard, flick your face – to make you fight. Because once they’ve got you violent, then they know how to handle you. The only thing they don’t know how to handle is non-violence and humor." John Lennon


Heres another great one: "Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives. ... I think we're being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and I think I'm liable to be put away as insane for expressing that. That's what's insane about it." - John Lennon
Thats why Ghandi was so effective.... He didnt feed into them trying to incite violence.


So, i believe we are in a phase of pre revolution on a global scale. Alot of people see it coming, its coming one way or the other, i mean we are on a time limit here on how much longer the earth can support this current economic model before we kill ourselves.


So for now, i protest. Any chance i get. I basically try and wake as many people up as i can. Its a numbers game. All we need to do to win, is have enough people to do what iceland did. Just walk up to parliament house or the white house or whatever. And declare in 1voice, your fired. You work for us, you are fired.


re draw new constitutions with much more technical concepts for a new age. i think the concept of a new foundation of law should essentially be, a frame work for what laws WE CANT MAKE. As in, a new framework that focuses solely on equality, civil liberties and equilibrium with the environment. Just my 2 cents...



SO for now, i think your best bet is education. Education is the key, thats why we are winning. Because we have unlimited information. At our fingertips. Educate yourself on how things are working, delve into history a bit. Keep tabs on current political movements and geo political movements. Just learn something new every day. Then share that information with people. Help wake others up



Its just a ripple effect. I help educate 20 people, they each help educate another 20. It compounds exponentially rapidly. This is all coupled with people becoming self aware…
And its getting easier to do it. This used to be such a taboo topic, it still is. it was SOOO much easier to dismiss this notion 20 years ago or even 10 years ago....


When there is a clear voice of NOOOO from the people to these crazy legislative measures around the world, which is synchronising so coincidentally and obviously, it is making it more and more obvious what is happening. That governments in most places are not listening to the people. That they keep representing the richest people on the planet whilst masquerading as democracy. Its become easier to see now.


TLDR: Educate yourself, be positive, protest anything and everything that takes your interest (its really fun), share the information and help create a peaceful revolution in our lifetime.
