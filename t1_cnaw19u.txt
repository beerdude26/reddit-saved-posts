There's a channel expressly created for beginners that want to seek help without feeling like they're being disruptive or needy: #haskell-beginners

It has a couple simple rules (for now): don't interrupt somebody else's learning process and be nice.

The IRC channel is a way for me to patch over the limitations of the learning material available. It's simply the best we can do for now. The book I am working on is designed for independent learners and should enable people to learn Haskell with less intervention.

Nobody is in #haskell-beginners that isn't there to learn or teach. I think somebody's about to get a monad transformers tutorial as we speak.

Not availing yourself of the time people are volunteering reduces the number of datapoints we have to work with for fixing how Haskell is taught and learned. It also deprives you of the opportunity to learn more and learn more quickly.

If it's a medium that absolutely doesn't work for you, find a Haskell buddy to co-learn with that you'd feel comfortable exploring things with over Skype/Hangouts or in person. Realistically, IRC is where the expertise is.

Another good alternate option is the mailing list. Tons o' knowledgeable people in the beginners and cafe mailing lists, but the IRC channel has people devoted to teaching effectively as a specific skill.

I don't think it's cause to worry. I was witness to a decade of people learning C, Python, and Common Lisp via IRC.
