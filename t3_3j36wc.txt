The recent tutorial on the `time` package is awesome! It was only written once the community expressed a desire on here to have a tutorial for it.

I wonder what else people are wanting a tutorial on, but haven't voiced it?

Furthermore, I wonder what tutorials exist that aren't commonly linked to or available?

To help answer those questions, I decided to start a [Github repository](https://github.com/parsonsmatt/hasktuts) to collect *requests* for beginner/introductory tutorials as well as links to tutorials. If you're wanting to see a tutorial for some library or idea, please submit an issue, and we can start getting this off the ground.
