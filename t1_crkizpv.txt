Lightly blanch the sprouts, meanwhile, wrap mini sausages in bacon and place in the bottom of a large baking dish. Drain the sprouts and add to the dish. Break up a block of Stilton and crumble over the dish. Pour in double cream about half full. Bake for 30 minutes. Younger sprouts are best. 

Every christmas, my favourite dish.
