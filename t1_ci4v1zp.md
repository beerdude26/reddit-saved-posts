Pornhub? My friend, you are living in the dark ages of fapping!

Pornhub is owned by Mindgeek, a conglomerate that also happens to own Brazzers, Reality Kings, Beeg, Keez, YouPorn, RedTube, XTube, an several more. They're in it to entice you to pay full price over at their main sites. That's why you'll rarely, if ever, see a full HD movie on those sites. They use the 8-minute trailers. Fine if you just want flashes of dick in pussy. No good if you're looking for a holistic porn experience, like I am. I get off the gestalt of pornography. 

Some suggestions for other metasearches that don't have vested interests:

- Fapdu.com  
- Palimas.com (THE BEST!)  
- tblop.com
- Fantasti.cc  
- Nudevista.com 
- Bing.com (it's amazing for porn search if you know exactly what you're looking for)  
- xnxx.com 
- tubegalore.com 
- wixvi.com 

There are more, but that's a good start. 

I dream of a world of open-source
porn. I believe in the freedom of the fap. 

----------------------------- 

EDIT: Also, thank you /u/steelbubble for some more good ones

- eporner.com  
- vporn.com  

----------------------------- 

EDIT 2: /u/TooSexyForMyself recommends jellypeep.com, which I've never heard of but sounds amazing. 

----------------------------- 

EDIT 3: Not to be an asshole, but coming back to an inbox full of "." is super duper annoying and unnecessary. You can save comments now. I want to share fap sources with as many people as I can, but I'm gonna have to delete the comment if I get all that punctuation. Thanks!

EDIT 3.1: OK, so the commenting to save later seems inevitable. That's the price of fapping freedom, I suppose. Think of me tonight when you beat it. But at least make it creative. Please? Anything other than "."

----------------------------- 

EDIT 4: Regarding torrents - be careful. I'm not condoning it and I'm not condemning it. But I do know that certain porn companies have actually seeded their own movies, in an effort to entrap people in their honeypot. Not the good kind, either. They hired a lawyer named John Steele to spearhead it. You can read about it [here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/10/15/how-porn-copyright-lawyer-john-steele-justifies-his-pursuit-of-sometimes-innocent-porn-pirates/) They would contact individuals directly, threatening legal action unless they settled. Sometimes they'd use extortion tactics, threatening to make public the individual's name and porn-watching habits. Shame runs deep, and they played on that. It's fucking reprehensible. 

The worst offender seems to be X-Art. So, **FUCK YOU X-ART** Fuck you and your over-sanitized, glossy, unemotional, polished, dialogue-free porn.  As morally questionable as downloading torrents may be, this is light years worse. Be careful, my fapping friends.
