Mr. Clean Magic Erasers.

They're just melamine sponges.  You can order hundreds for like 8 dollars.  Paying more than a few cents each, you're just spreading your cheeks.

edit:  Some folks asked where to get them for that cheap, so here ya go!

Order it early, and like any order from China, you forget about it after a week.  Then, one day, it's like Christmas in Feb/Mar!

edit:  Gold, awww thanks :)  I don't know what that means/does :O
