Stalker mods have really let the game grow over the years despite the developer's lack of presence. The mods that have come out of the scene have ranged from bug fixes to complete overhauls. In this post I'll list off mods I've either A) Played or B) Heard excellent things about. 

**A bit of a warning:** 

**MOST MODS ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH EACH OTHER!**
Vanilla Stalker is buggy, some mods make it buggier. Prepare yourself for crashes and remind yourself to keep calm and cheeki breeki. **Save Games usually are not compatible from mod to mod.**

**Installing Mods**

Most mods (if a installer is not included) rely on dropping a "gamedata" folder into your stalker directory. Uninstalling them is as simple as deleting this folder. Mods with installers will usually come with uninstallers. 

**If your game fails to start, do the following:**

1. Delete gamedata folder, try to start game. If it crashes:
2. Verify game cache, try to start game. If it still crashes:
3. Uninstall game and delete folder. This is your last resort and you probably will never have to do it.

**Tips**

* Make a copy of your vanilla game folder before modding and keep it around. It's really convenient to delete a modded game folder and just bring over the vanilla game contents to get a fresh start. It's a huge time saver. 

**S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Lost Alpha Free Standalone Game**

* **[Lost Alpha](http://www.moddb.com/mods/lost-alpha)** - Want to play Stalker for free? Well here's one way but it's more than that. It's a reimagining of SOC with everything from levels to interface. Story lines are altered and original concepts from SOC's development were reintroduced. Huge project and a great standalone game. [Features](http://www.moddb.com/mods/lost-alpha) - [Downloads](http://www.moddb.com/mods/lost-alpha/downloads)

**S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl (SOC)**

The first in the series and what many will say is the best of the original three. Released in 2007 and while it brought many computers to their knees, this game was groundbreaking. The modding scene was (and still is) strong with this one.

**Bugfixing mods (aka mods that don't alter the vanilla game TOO much)**

* **[The Zone Reclamation Project](http://www.metacognix.com/stlkrsoc/)** A community effort to fix everything broken with the game. Supposedly compatible with many other mods. [Downloads](http://www.metacognix.com/files/stlkrsoc/index.html) - [Features](http://www.metacognix.com/stlkrsoc/index.html)
* **[Old Good Stalker Evolution \(OGSE\)](http://www.moddb.com/mods/old-good-stalker-evolution)** - This mod is specifically aimed towards bugfixing the vanilla game. Promises better performance and a very customizable experience. While this is mostly a stability mod, it adds various things like drivable vehicles, monsters, blowouts, and gun balancing. [Features](http://www.moddb.com/mods/old-good-stalker-evolution/features/ogse-features-and-changes) - [Download](http://www.moddb.com/mods/old-good-stalker-evolution/downloads/ogse-0692-r2-official-english-version-fixed)
* **[Stalker Complete 2009](http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-complete-2009)** - The Complete series is one of the most well-known and popular mods though not all will agree with the decisions took in development for it. Included are new textures, sounds, music, weather, bug fixes, AI improvements, interface and more. Many reccommend it to first time Stalkers who want a more modern looking game without changing the vanilla gameplay too much. Some will bash it for having altered some difficulty settings and making the game "easier" which is subjective and I don't have an issue with. **NOTE** Some redditors have pointed out this mod is rather outdated and is not the best to recommend to new players wanting a vanilla experience.

**Graphical Overhauls**

This category can overlap with the bugfixing mods but most of these focus on amazing visuals instead of bugfixing

* **[Autumn Aurora 2](http://www.moddb.com/mods/autumn-aurora-compilation-mod)** - One of my favorite mods for SHOC as it completely changes the look and feel of the already amazing atmosphere. New tree models, textures, weather, sounds, weapons, and music. It's hard to describe the pure beauty of this mod but trust me, it's [gorgeous](http://media.moddb.com/images/mods/1/19/18131/4500_screenshots_2014-09-19_00051.jpg).

* **[Dynamic Shaders](http://www.moddb.com/mods/dynamic-shaders)** - Newly released graphical engine overhaul which adds better lighting, dynamic textures, DOF, and other visual features. [Downloads](http://www.moddb.com/mods/dynamic-shaders/downloads) - [Features](http://www.moddb.com/mods/dynamic-shaders)

**Gameplay Overhauls**

These mods change a lot. Most add many weapons while others change the element of gameplay. 


* **[L.U.R.K.](http://www.moddb.com/mods/lurk)** - This mod makes Stalker even harder. No minimap, limited ammo and a grueling environment. Recommended for experienced stalkers and TURN YOUR CROSSHAIR OFF! This mod makes you appreciate your pistol. New models, over 80 weapons, animations, ballistics, weather, interface, and overhauled stealth mechanics. [Download](http://www.moddb.com/mods/lurk/downloads/lurk-11) - [Features](http://www.moddb.com/mods/lurk/features)
* **[STALKERSOUP](http://www.tecnobacon.com/home.html)** - One of the biggest community modpacks to date. Adds 30+ locations, 14+ monsters, 13 factions, insane amount of weapons, and plenty of new quests promising 200-300 hours of content. The feature list is too big to put here but trust me, it's huge. Creator is technobacon and the latest thread on Steam for it is over [1000 pages long](http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2031941). It even has its own [Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/stalkersoup/). This is a huge mod, I can't stress that enough. [Download](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/stalkersoup/discussions/0/882961586804282227/) - [Features](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/07/26/stalker-soup-narodnaya-solyanka/) 
* **[Stalker Joint Pak 2 \(AKA Narodnaya Solyanka Cumulative Pack 2\)](http://stalkermod.ru/MODYI-Teni-CHernobyilya/stalker-obedinennyy-pak-2-op-2.html)** - Have yet to try this but supposedly overpassing STALKERSOUP in features and size. Most of what I see is in Russian but I'm sure most people can figure out how to install it. [Download](http://www.gsc-game.com/index.php?t=community&amp;s=forums&amp;s_game_type=xr&amp;thm_page=1&amp;thm_id=22935&amp;sec_id=17) - [Features](http://stalkermod.ru/MODYI-Teni-CHernobyilya/stalker-obedinennyy-pak-2-op-2.html)
* **F.O.T.O.G.R.A.F.** - Instead of shooting bullets you'll be shooting pictures as you document the zone. Very interesting concept. [Thread with more information](http://www.gsc-game.com/index.php?t=community&amp;s=forums&amp;s_game_type=xr&amp;thm_page=1&amp;thm_id=22165&amp;sec_id=16) 
* **[PRIBOI STORY](http://www.gsc-game.com/index.php?t=community&amp;s=forums&amp;offset=300)** - Adds a new story line and made from the same developers who eventually went to make one of the most popular mods of the 3rd installment, MISERY for Call of Pripyat. Tons of features and completely new experience for SOC. [Features and Download](http://www.gsc-game.com/index.php?t=community&amp;s=forums&amp;offset=300)
* **[Faction Wars](http://www.gsc-game.com/index.php?t=community&amp;s=forums&amp;s_game_type=xr&amp;thm_page=96&amp;thm_id=16864&amp;page=1&amp;sort=ASC&amp;sec_id=16)** - Brings Faction Wars to SOC. Factions will act independently and take over territory around the zone. Eventually turning into a warzone. [Zone Wars](http://www.mediafire.com/download/96cqdnxssjq909y/Zone+Wars+-+V1.1.7z) was built on top of this so it may be more up to date. [Features](http://www.gsc-game.com/index.php?t=community&amp;s=forums&amp;s_game_type=xr&amp;thm_page=96&amp;thm_id=16864&amp;page=1&amp;sort=ASC&amp;sec_id=16) - [Download](http://stalker.filefront.com/file/Faction_Wars;97459)

**S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky**

Second game in the series released in 2008. Very bad reception at first due to bugs and poor optimization. Modders have gave the game a little love over the years but it is still considered the red-headed stepchild of the series.

**Vanilla Experience**

* **[OGSM](http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-clear-sky-ogsm-18-ce-2014-gereng/features/stalker-clear-sky-ogsm-18-ce-english-feature-list)** - Similar to OGSE and Complete, this mod aims to rebuild the vanilla experience while optimizing and adding a few features.

**Graphical Overhauls**

Fantastic mod. [Features](http://www.gsc-game.com/index.php?t=community&amp;s=forums&amp;s_game_type=xr2&amp;thm_page=1&amp;thm_id=22757&amp;sec_id=22) - [Downloads](http://www.gsc-game.com/index.php?t=community&amp;s=forums&amp;s_game_type=xr2&amp;thm_page=1&amp;thm_id=23060&amp;sec_id=21)
* **[Arsenal Overhaul](http://www.moddb.com/mods/arsenal-overhaul-clear-sky)** - One of my favorite mods for Clear Sky as it adds high quality weapons and animations to the game. This could be listed under Vanilla as well but it's a fantastic mod that adds a bunch of bugfixing, graphical features and new items. [Features](http://www.moddb.com/mods/arsenal-overhaul-clear-sky/features/aocs-features) - [Downloads](http://www.moddb.com/mods/arsenal-overhaul-clear-sky/downloads/arsenal-overhaul-clear-sky-10)

**S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call of Pripyat**

Finally we get to my favorite in the series. Released in 2010 this game was applauded for being the most stable and optimized game in the series. It also has had huge modding support from the scene.

**Vanilla Experience**

* **[Complete](http://www.moddb.com/mods/call-of-pripyat-complete)** - Yet another Complete mod for CoP. Does the same as the previous mods in the series. **NOTE** Supposedly unstable. [Features](http://www.moddb.com/mods/call-of-pripyat-complete) - [Downloads](http://www.moddb.com/mods/call-of-pripyat-complete/downloads)

**Graphical Overhauls**

* **[AtmosFear](http://www.moddb.com/mods/atmosfear-for-call-of-pripyat)** - One of the more popular weather mods for the series. Completely changes the feel of the world. Accurate sun positioning, longer nights with moon phases, new skyboxes, blowouts, fallouts, and psi storms. A must have mod that is usually included in other mods. [Features](http://www.moddb.com/mods/atmosfear-for-call-of-pripyat) - [Downloads](http://www.moddb.com/mods/atmosfear-for-call-of-pripyat/downloads)

**Gameplay Overhauls**

* **[Misery](http://www.miserymod.com/)** - You can't hear people talk about Stalker mods without hearing about Misery. This mod completely overhauls the game into a grueling torture of difficulty and detail. Hundreds of new items, gun repair mechanics, in depth artifact mechanics, and more. This is NOT for the feint of heart, but many will argue it makes Stalker feel more like a Stalker game should feel. Unforgiving but rewarding. [Features](http://www.miserymod.com/?page_id=1222) - [Downloads](http://www.miserymod.com/?page_id=799) - [Armed Zone Addon](http://www.moddb.com/mods/misery-the-armed-zone)
* **[Arsenal Overhaul](http://www.moddb.com/mods/arsenal-overhaul)** - This mod adds tons of guns with excellent textures, sounds, and animations. Very vanilla experience but with more equipment. Highly recommended. [Features](http://www.moddb.com/mods/arsenal-overhaul/features/features77) - [Downloads](http://www.moddb.com/mods/arsenal-overhaul/downloads/arsenal-overhaul-2411)
* **[Shoker Weapon Mod](http://www.moddb.com/mods/shoker-weapon-mod)** - Tons of new guns (93 models), fantastic animations, weapon extensions, gear and more. [Features](http://www.moddb.com/mods/shoker-weapon-mod/features/weapons-list-eng) - [Downloads](http://www.moddb.com/mods/shoker-weapon-mod/downloads)
* **[SGM aka Sigerous Mod](http://www.moddb.com/mods/sigerous-sgm)** - Haven't tried it but from the little I can find it seems to be a big overhaul. [Features](http://www.moddb.com/mods/sigerous-sgm) - [Downloads](http://www.moddb.com/mods/sigerous-sgm/downloads)
