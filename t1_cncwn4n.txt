A cop is sitting in his usual speed trap spot and sees a truck drive by with the back full of penguins.  He is understandably perplexed so he pulls the truck over.

"Excuse me sir, but why do you have all those penguins in the back of your truck?"

"I'm sorry officer, but I just don't know what to do with them!"

Incredulous, the officer responds, "take them to the zoo!"

The driver thanks the officer and drives off.  The next day the cop is in the same spot and dang-it-all if that same truck doesn't drive by again, but this time the penguins are all wearing sunglasses.  The frustrated cop again pulls the truck over.

"I thought I told you to take those penguins to the zoo!"

"I did officer, today we're going to the beach!"
