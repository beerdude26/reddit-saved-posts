If you browse through Lens entry on hackage, Lens Github's repo, or even google about Lens, you will find a lot of partial references such as introductory tutorials/videos, examples, overviews and so on. Since I already know most of the basics, I am looking for a more complete reference that would help me to get more knowledge about the advanced features. In other words, I still have no idea what [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ekmett/lens/images/Hierarchy.png) means and couldn't find a resource complete enough to explain this graphic as a whole. Ideas?
