There was a great story about this exact subject on [The Moth Radio Hour](http://themoth.org/posts/stories/youre-so-screwed). Guy finds out he's losing his sight and once it's gone, feels like the world is just...boring. So he researches all these things to do now that he's blind and ends up going to a rattlesnake festival. Very cool and entertaining story.
