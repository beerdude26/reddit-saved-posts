I've run a lot of people through learning Haskell.

For the time being, I don't recommend books precisely, rather, I recommend a couple of courses that you can do for free online.

[My guide for learning Haskell lists what I'd suggest.](https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell)

If you'd like some rationale, I have [a post about this](http://bitemyapp.com/posts/2014-12-31-functional-education.html).

I *am* working on [a book](http://haskellbook.com/) with my [coauthor Julie](https://superginbaby.wordpress.com/) who'd never programmed before learning Haskell but it doesn't cover as much as cis194 and NICTA Course *yet*. It'll be at parity in October. I wouldn't recommend our book yet unless you're up for a bit of adventure and would like to contribute feedback. That said, I do think the book is more thorough WRT the basics already and a fair bit easier than face-planting into the recursion exercises in week 1 of cis194.

Also, regarding cis194, I've gotten permission from Brent Yorgey to make a community edited cis194 course. I've started that [at this git repo](https://github.com/bitemyapp/open-cis194). Currently I am trying to get it flipped into an updated and relatively vanilla Hakyll project. I'm also using [semantic-ui](http://semantic-ui.com/) for the styling and grid. If anybody would be willing to help me with this, I'd very much appreciate it.
