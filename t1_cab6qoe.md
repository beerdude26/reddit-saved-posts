&gt; I think I would miss the static type system and algebraic data types very much, further I like Haskellâ€™s purity and lazy evaluation

It sounds like you're heavily invested in the Haskell mindset, and that anything else will feel inferior to you. So I'd suggest you learn Lisp purely as a way of reminding yourself that There's More Than One Way To Do It :-)

But here's a fun exercise, anyway: work through Paul Graham's book [On Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html) translating the sample code to Haskell. When I tried this a few years ago, I found that the code samples from the early chapters became shorter and arguably clearer when translated to Haskell, but that the translation quickly became more difficult and unwieldy, and that by the middle of chapter 3 it was often impossible (for me, at least) to translate the Lisp code into a finite Haskell program. That's probably not the case any more, as Template Haskell's had a lot of work done on it since, but I expect the translations will still be awkward and lengthy.
