Alright, let me get a torrent all set up. I might have to re-render with a target bitrate in mind because the quality isn't quite where I want it to be. These sources truly are appalling. Oh well.

EDIT: Just a heads up, this file will take ~an hour to re-encode: http://i.imgur.com/pefF5jS.png

EDIT 2: ETA is ~40 minutes for completion of render and then probably 5 for torrent indexing. I'll make sure to throw a mega link up there as well for everyone who prefers direct downloading.

EDIT 3: Thanks for the gold!

EDIT 4: [Here's a TPB link.](http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11612559) Mega is in the process of uploading.

EDIT 5: [Here's the Mega link!](https://mega.co.nz/#!ooZCiQob!iCev2SIM-Bywm_EreUt1Ky697O0dmNWk8eyGaby2noU) Enjoy everyone!

EDIT 6: Triple gilded? Holy shit!

EDIT 7: I'll be recutting in HD (if copying a cut can even be called cutting) and posting periodic updates to the new subreddit /r/starwarsprecut - Subscribe if you like.

**Also, on an unrelated note, if anyone here is a fan of Mass Effect, [feel free to check out the podcast I work on, GMZW.](http://gmzw.tumblr.com/) It's a lot of fun.**
