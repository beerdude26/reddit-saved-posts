It really depends on your definition of real-world.

Maybe you could reimplement the last project you did in haskell ?

Otherwise, you could code a small project to fetch numbers in parallel from random.org api, and collect some statistics. This would introduce you to different libraries.

Also, read this : [What I wish I knew when learning Haskell](http://www.stephendiehl.com/what)
It goes through many pitfalls and idioms.
