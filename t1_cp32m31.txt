&gt; I've often contemplated how I would describe color to a person who was blind. How would you describe color?

&gt; Red is hot and spicy, like standing too close to the fire.

&gt; Orange is warm and smooth, a velvet curtain heated by the sun. 

&gt; Yellow is buttery and rich, like sunshine on your face. 

&gt; Green is earthy and comforting, the smell of fresh pine needles. 

&gt; Blue is cool and crisp, like dipping your foot in a lake in October. 

&gt; Purple is dark and rich, a baritone sax bellowing jazz. 

&gt; Brown is healing and ancient, the smell of earth on the forest floor.
