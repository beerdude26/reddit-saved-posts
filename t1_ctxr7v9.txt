[Gatsby Body Paper](http://www.amazon.com/Gatsby-Deodorant-Paper-Citrus-sheets/dp/B0012UDAYA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1439192868&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=gatsby+body), looks like they have some on Amazon for a little more than double the price here but if you use it once a day it will last you a month. 

They are pretty amazing and well worth it.
