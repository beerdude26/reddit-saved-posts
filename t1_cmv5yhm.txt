I personally thought [*Adventures in Classical Land*](https://www.haskell.org/wikiupload/1/14/TMR-Issue6.pdf) by Dan Piponi was awesome. It gives a pretty strong (IMO) introduction into using Curry-Howard with classical-logic, and it's written to be more approachable than other papers on the same topic (i.e. it doesn't assume a lot of prior knowledge on the subject, as posts below have said is a problem with other papers). It certainly helped me!
