I came up with the need of using a function that retrieved both minimal and maximal value in a list. I havenâ€™t found that function yet, so I wrote a little implementation:

    minmax :: (Ord a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; (a,a)
    minmax []     = error "empty list: minmax"
    minmax (x:xs) = foldl (\(mn,mx) a -&gt; (min mn a,max mx a)) (x,x) xs

I guess that can also be written as `minmax :: (Ord a,Foldable f)`.

What do you think? Should such a function be in `Data.Ord`, `Data.List` or whatever?
