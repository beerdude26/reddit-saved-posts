But it's okay, it's for my long-term health.

I didn't even notice how I work in PHP: quickly hack some code together, get a proof of concept, see if that can be expanded to meet the requirements, then worry about building in error conditions, validation and other such things later. Working in Haskell + Snap (and with Haskell's type system) I'm forced to make something that works completely, instead of hacking together something that (almost) works and building from there.

If I had understood my own terrible practices sooner, I would have done something about them, but it was Haskell that exposed me to myself.

That Haskell shows the developer things about themselves even they didn't know is enough to make it worth learning. It's mind-bending and ideology-exposing.
