In a large number of posts/pages/discussions/etc., I keep seeing something along the lines of "When learning Haskell, if you don't understand something, ask on IRC." Something about this recommendation, which I see very often, feels irksome to me. To illustrate, when I wanted to learn how to program in Python, I picked up a Python book, read it and practiced the exercises until I felt comfortable with it, wrote increasing complex programs, and so on and so on. However, with Haskell, it feels as if the expected approach is "pick up a Haskell book, learn something, ask a question on IRC, hope someone is available to answer the question, hope that person knows the answer to answer the question, hope that person has the patience to answer that question, hope that person is not having a bad day, hope that person is not sick of you asking questions which should otherwise be pretty obvious, hope you don't become addicted to that person's kindness, hope others don't start seeing you as some sort of 'psychic leech', hope you recognize when you should stop asking questions and go back to the original text, and continue from there, repeating along the way". Now, *maybe* it's just me and *maybe* I am misinterpreting expectations but something about this **perceived** process strikes me as flawed. I am not familiar with any other arena where such an approach has ever worked in any sustainable fashion. Maybe I'm too attached to the idea of individual initiative but it just feels as if, if I were to take this (perceived) approach, I'm not going to feel/be any more than infantile with respect to Haskell programming and, having said it out loud, that really feels more discouraging than I expected it too. Am I the only one finding this approach troubling? Is there some aspect of this method I have somehow missed? I hope I don't seem appreciative of the willingness of others to help; I just know ... well ... I know me and how I get, so to speak. I know it is very very easy for me to become a "psychic leech" and I trying very hard to keep myself from doing so. It just feels as if the "ask on IRC" recommendation is just inviting "psychic leeches".
