I started working on Haskell projects (I am a product manager working for FP Complete) with developers and a pattern is emerging which is there isn't enough tutorials and samples teaching how to build an end-to-end Haskell application! 

If you have an application that you developed in Haskell, I would love to hear from you and we can together make it into a tutorial to teach others and share the knowledge promoting and encouraging more developers to use Haskell for commercial applications. 

Got an app? Let me know!
