Feel bad later, take action first.

* Change the passwords for your email, bank accounts, phone account, etc.

* Get a PO box

* File a change of address with the Post office, no need to see her just to get your junk mail.

* Contact the bank and make sure she does not have access to your money. Change your mailing address to the PO Box. Open new accounts if the old ones were joint and have them remove you from the old one.

* Pull out enough cash for a couple days, until the new cards show up

* Change your direct deposit information, if you use direct deposit

* Contact the credit card companies and request new cards. Change your address with them.

* Cancel any automatic draws for the house that are paid on your account - Cable, Phone, Electric. Close any accounts in your name / social

* Change Facebook / Twitter / Instagram, etc logins

* Make sure she is removed as beneficiary of any log-term or retirement accounts, along with insurance through your employer

* Pack up anything valuable or sentimental and get a storage unit. Clothes and other items can be replaced later if necessary.

* GET TESTED FOR STD'S - if she was taking pictures this time, I would bet it wasn't the first.

It sounds cold, but you have a small window to get your items in line to protect yourself. You can find a friend to get sloppy drink with later after the window closes.

Do not accept any excuse from her. She cheated, took pictures, and then crawled back into bed with you like nothing happened. The relationship is already dead. Move forward.
