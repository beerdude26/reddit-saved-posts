title: Can anyone recommend some tranquil ambient electronica?

I'm looking for background electronica to listen to while I work. Simple, repetitive beats, no vocals, nothing too attention grabbing, but pleasant and slightly ethereal.

Edit - Thanks everyone. I'm checking out Tycho, Boards of Canada, Eluvium, Aphex Twin, and Brian Eno. If you have any further recommendations, please include specific albums. Thanks! :)

**EDIT - PLEASE NO MORE PMs. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUGGESTIONS BUT I AM COMPLETELY SWAMPED WITH THEM.**
