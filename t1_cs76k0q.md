So there's this really great Sci-Fi novel called "The Stars my Destination" where this happens and the author does a really great job of building a world around it. Also the plot is heavily based on The Count of Monte Cristo, and if you aren't down for that then you can get right the fuck out.

The book opens with a researcher accidentally stumbling into the realization that all humans have the ability to teleport. This is a defensive mechanism that is usually triggered by extreme danger, but can be honed so the user can control it. You can only "jaunt" as it's called to locations you have been previously because you need to be able to visualize the location, and there is a rough maximum distance that you can jaunt, though this varies from person to person (if this sounds familiar...it's because that shit-film Jumper ripped it off). Fast forward several hundred years and people have built a society around this, where living in Egypt and working in Alaska is commonplace. There is still traditional transportation in the form of around the world tours, but the prices for these are insanely high and are treated as a rite of adulthood, when you reach a certain age it's expected that your parents will send you on one of these so you can tour and visualize all of the "jaunting platforms" across the world.

Prisons have to be heavily modified, a prisoner must be sedated during transport and the prisons themselves are labyrinthine, massive, and too far from habitable planets for a jaunt.

Space travel still works the way you'd expect through, since the distances between planets is much to far for a jaunt.

It's a great book. Would definitely recommend.
