While I'm aware of [using Emacs for Haskell development](https://github.com/serras/emacs-haskell-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial.md#using-emacs-for-haskell-development), I wonder if it would be possible to also use Sublime Text 3.  
Given that there's the [SublimeHaskell](https://github.com/SublimeHaskell/SublimeHaskell) plugin, I'd like to know if anyone's using it for large-scale Haskell development.  
Are there any alternatives in Sublime Text 3?
