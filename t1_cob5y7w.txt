Paint those pads up with a vinyl based spray paint and you've got yourself a real acoustic pad. Laminate an 1/8" of rubber to the back and you've got high end sound proofing panels. As mentioned elsewhere, convolute the panels with the classic "egg crate" and you've got even more sound dampening (the pyramid shape works too).

Also, melamine is treated with flame retardants, it probably won't burn until a bunch of other stuff around it is also burning hot enough to ignite it. I could pull the tech data sheet, but off the top of my head, it is rated UL94HF1.
