Not sure if feeding a troll, but I'll bite.First, there's a philosophical reason: We have locks on bathroom doors, curtains in our sitting rooms, wear swimming clothes, plant hedges and would be offended if our neighbor had a telescope pointing towards our garden or, when invited into our home, entered our bedroom without a reason to do so. None of the things that take place behind these covers are harmful, but we would still like to create a space where we can exist without observation. We don't hide behind these covers, we merely create space where judgment is less likely. Then there's a historical reason: History shows that when states ask for these intimate spaces to be observable, they are progressing towards, or have already arrived to, totalitarianism. Allowing judgment, from some towards others, of legal but intimate activities, historically seems to indicate that some or all of these intimate activities are about to be ridiculed, looked down upon or made illegal.Then there's a practical reason: Many recent news stories show that the state, and the companies it asks to do its bidding obtaining information about our intimate activities, is unable to safeguard the data that results. This indicates that, even if trusting the state, you are likely to have your data in the hands of people you do not trust very shortly.Then, there's a balancing reason: While we accept that the state exists to ensure that your freedom doesn't encroach on my freedom, we have previously balanced the need for intimacy/privacy and the need to safekeep everyone by way of independent review. The police are not the judges. The judges are not the lawmakers. The lawmakers are not the police. These independent institutions are in place to check and balance how each institution behaves. If they merge, again, history shows us that bad things result. In the particular case of the Snoopers Charter, there is not enough interaction of all these institutions.
