I released Nomyx V0.7, the only game where You can change the rules!    
Here is the website: www.nomyx.net    
Here is a video introduction of the game: http://vimeo.com/58265498    
I created a tutorial to learn how to play: http://www.corentindupont.info/blog/posts/2014-09-23-first-Nomyx-tutorial.html    

Let's start a new game! I propose to call it "The Space Merchants". Dear rulers, this part of the Galaxy is yours...    
Please login to the game here: www.nomyx.net:8000/Nomyx.    
The corresponding forum thread is here: http://www.nomyx.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=1525&amp;p=1739    
Please also register on the mailing list to follow the game: nomyx-game@googlegroups.com    
     
    
Some background: this is an implementation of a Nomic [1] game in Haskell (I believe the first complete implementation of a Nomic game on a computer). In a Nomyx game you can change the rules of the game itself while playing it. The players can submit new rules or modify existing ones, thus completely changing the behaviour of the game through time. The rules are managed and interpreted by the computer. They must be written in the Nomyx language, which is a subset of Haskell.
