I am having no trouble at all in getting Haskell basics. Function, currying, purity, laziness, monads somewhat. All have a lot of great resource options. But just having finished the LYAH book, I have no idea where to go now. I see you guys talking about advanced things all the time - GADTs, Lenses, REPA, monad transformers. I see a lot of cool libraries with no explanations or tutorials. There doesn't seems to be many Haskell books. It is becoming harder and harder to get further down the rabbit hole.

So, considering that lack of resources and courses for advanced stuff, it would be really great if you compiled a list of the available Haskell resources. Books, tutorials, blog posts. One complete enough to contain everything someone should read to go from complete novice to mastery by himself.
