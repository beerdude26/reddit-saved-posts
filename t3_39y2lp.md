After a long process of trial and error, I've finally managed to set up a nice environment for Haskell on Windows.

Here is how I did it in case you are another beginner in trouble.

#GHC, Cabal and packages

First of all, download and install the [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/windows.html). The current version, 2014.2.0.0, has a bug: `cabal init` doesn't work.

To fix that, upgrade cabal from version 1.18.x to version 1.20.0.0 with the following commands:

1. cd c:\
2. cabal update
3. cabal install Cabal-1.20.0.0 cabal-install-1.20.0.0

Now you need to delete or rename the executables in `C:\Program Files\Haskell Platform\2014.2.0.0\lib\extralibs\bin` (your directory might be different) so that the new cabal is visible. This way you don't need to mess with environment variables.

Now you need to install some additional packages:

1. cd c:\
2. cabal install hlint stylish-haskell ghc-mod

It's very likely that some packages will refuse to install. If the name of the offending package is `name`, you need to install the package like this:

1. cabal unpack name
2. cabal install ./name-x.x.x.x

Of course, you must replace `name-x.x.x.x` with the exact directory created by the first command. Now you can remove the directory:

* rd /s name-x.x.x.x

It goes without saying that after you managed to install the offending package you need to reissue the command `cabal install hlint stylish-haskell ghc-mod`. Repeat this process as many times as you need.

# IDE

This is simple.

Install [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (the community edition will do) and then install the plugin for Haskell authored by JetBrains.

*DO NOT INSTALL HASKFORCE*

The plugin by JetBrains is more complete. For instance you can start a Haskell REPL and send a .hs file to the REPL all without leaving the IDE.

# Debugging

Go to File-&gt;Settings-&gt;Build, Execution, Deployment-&gt;Haskell Debugger and choose GHCi as "Prefered (sic) Debugger".

# Troubleshooting

If you get a gchi-mod error in IntelliJ, copy `ghc.exe` from

    C:\Program Files\Haskell Platform\2014.2.0.0\bin

to

    %AppData\cabal\bin

If you do this, you also need to move `cabal.exe` from

    %AppData\cabal\bin

to

    C:\Program Files\Haskell Platform\2014.2.0.0\lib\extralibs\bin

If you copy `ghc.exe` but don't do this, `cabal init` and other commands won't work.

#Please let me know if you have a cleaner way to set all this up on Windows. My method isn't pretty but it works.
