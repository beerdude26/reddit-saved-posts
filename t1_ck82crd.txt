The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat: And Other Clinical Tales is a fantastic series of real cases and a layman's explanation about what happened with people who had unusual mental situations. I really, really, really recommend it. 

For example, people who have their perception of their body skewed, causing what is known as alien limb, where the limb you see attached to you does not seem to be your own, and sometimes tends to do things on its own because the feedback loop is broken. Those people tend to either amputate the limb or fall into extreme depression and end up taking their own life. 

Edit: $11 bucks off amazon with prime for a [paperback version](http://smile.amazon.com/Man-Who-Mistook-His-Wife/dp/0684853949/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409761654&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=man+who+mistook+his+wife+for+a+hat). Linked to amazon smile version.
