If you haven't watched Double Fine Adventure Documentary I'd suggest watching that for sure. I think 343 is doing some documentary type stuff for Halo right now as well. 

Also Alot of old Giant Bomb E3 panels are really interesting. They are fun to listen to if you got the time to go through all the years they've done it.
