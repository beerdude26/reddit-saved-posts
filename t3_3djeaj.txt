title: Is there a book that's considered the "Haskell bible" like "effective c++" is? Reviews on Amazon are not convincing for any book

I'm determined to get Haskell under my belt at this point. But I'd really love a good book that's written for beginners, spares no detail, and is readable. Amazon reviews make me feel like I need to pick two out of three. 

I'm using web "tutorials" for now, but it's just not the same as buckling down with a serious book

The sidebar has some books, but see above. 

There's some Amazon books that come up when you search for "Haskell" about functional programming (instead of specifically Haskell). Am I better served there?
