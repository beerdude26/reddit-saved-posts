I've been reading through various releases, and what're some games that were hyped up and just faded?

I remember a lot of discussion about Thief (2014) pre-release, and pretty much nothing after. I didn't even know The Mighty Quest For Epic Loot came out, and the Playstation Move just kinda... happened.






Why does this happen, and what're some other examples?
