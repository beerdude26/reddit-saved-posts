Syntax weak, lines are heavy

Error while compiling already, Code's spaghetti

It's broken but on the surface it looks done and ready

To drop bombs but it keeps on resetting

Dropping all the pointers down, the whole goto goes so loud

It's crashing, how? Everything's segfaulting now!

The memory runs out, freeze up, over. Blow!
