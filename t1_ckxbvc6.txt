“WAR is a racket. It always has been. It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only one international in scope. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives.
A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. Only a small "inside" group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many. Out of war a few people make huge fortunes.
In the World War [I] a mere handful garnered the profits of the conflict. At least 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires were made in the United States during the World War. That many admitted their huge blood gains in their income tax returns. How many other war millionaires falsified their tax returns no one knows.” A speech delivered in 1933, by Major General Smedley Butler, USMC.

War is a commodity. War is profit. War is a mechanism used to destroy a host nations leader when they are not willing to bend to the will on the wealthy elites in their desire for resources or accepting the current economic model of control using a central bank. Every player in a war is funded by these wealthy elites. As waging war is expensive and creates more debt to that country. Destroying property means it requires to be rebuilt, which further funnels money into the corporations. It is pure profit in the hands of the people that own all the companies. The loss of millions of lives is irrelevant to the military industrial complex.

Money is power. Money is control. Without money you starve and are homeless. So you are free to enrol in the labour force or die. Money doesn’t mean anything to the people who own it all. They know it means nothing. They trick us into believing it means something but to them it is just POWER. The amount of money they have allows them to influence and control every nation on every level of the nation’s faculties and operations. If a nation resists control, there is a series of steps taken, ranging in severity till the country bends to their will. From sanctions to assassination, the international banking cabal employs a unique kind of manipulation and brute force, using field operatives known as economic hit men.

The last American president who attempted to expose this was JFK. He was assassinated. He intended to stop using a central bank and allow the country to print its own money once more, debt free. He also intended to stop the war machine.

The concept of a powerful countries leader being assassinated to create a new hierarchy and power structure is known as a coup d’etat.
A coup d'état also known as a coup, a putsch, or an overthrow, is the sudden and illegal seizure of a government, usually instigated by a small group of the existing state establishment to depose the established government and replace it with a new ruling body, civil or military. A coup d'état is considered successful when the usurpers establish their dominance. When the coup neither fails completely nor succeeds, a civil war is a likely consequence.
A coup d'état typically uses the extant government's power to assume political control of the country. In Coup d'État: A Practical Handbook[page needed], military historian Edward Luttwak states that "[a] coup consists of the infiltration of a small, but critical, segment of the state apparatus, which is then used to displace the government from its control of the remainder." The armed forces, whether military or paramilitary, can be a defining factor of a coup d'état.

If you think the concept that America has undergone a coup d’etat is unlikely, think again. An attempt was already made prior to JFK 30 years ago, against President rosevelt. The attempted coup d’état was allegedly orchestrated by Prominent wealthy businessmen.

In 1933 a plot to subvert a free peoples government was whistle blown by USMC General Smedley Butler and THAT is the only reason it did not succeed. 30 years later though…


People who delve down the path of not trusting government institutions do not call themselves conspiracy theorists. This is a word, which appeared in the 50’s and has been credited to the CIA and their program operation mockingbird.

What do you think when you hear the word CONSPIRACY THEORIST. I’ll take a guess, you think CRAZY. This is the power of repetition and programming. You hear those words used in conjunction often enough it becomes an association.  People who have gone down a path of questioning the system, questioning their own reality and investigating how the current social, economic, political and environmental constructs human beings have put into place actually work do not call themselves this. They call themselves Critical Thinkers.



It is to assess information without believing it and to fact check things you are told yourself and to be open minded to any new information presented to you even if it is contrary to your beliefs or current understanding of how things work.


"For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumour is printed, no secret is revealed." – JFK.


This speech was given 2 years before his assassination and it was about the spread of communism. I place this quote here because, others theorise it was saying something else. It was a foreshadowing about something JKF become aware of once in office. That it was an address to the world about the banking institutions in place and the stranglehold they had over sovereign nation’s freedoms. You decide for yourself.


Here’s a quote from one of the wealthiest people on the planet who is part of the central banking group of the world and one of the major players of the Bilderberg Group

“For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure--one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.” 
― David Rockefeller
