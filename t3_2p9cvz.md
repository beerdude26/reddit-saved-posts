I mean the **definition** of side effect. I know that IO operation will cause side effect, which is *not pure*.

I think it will be something like this. There is one thing called **inner world**, in which all operations are called pure. Then the interactions between this inner world and *other worlds* are causing side effects. 

But this conception is blur. 
* What is the inner world? 
* If there is a inner world, what makes an inner world? 
* Is side effect a relative conception? 

That makes me ask, what is exactly side effect?(Btw, I googled first.)
