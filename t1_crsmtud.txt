An animated short of Pinocchio, where he never turns to a real boy but spends his life as a wooden toy, but people around him treat his as real. He eventually becomes a great psychologist but it's replaced by a robot. 70's style animation. Seen late at night.
Edit: found it!!! Thank you kind stranger! Been 15 years looking for it.
