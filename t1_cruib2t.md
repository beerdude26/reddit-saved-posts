&gt; Python is probably less of a mind-bender than lisp or forth, though.

True.  
Lisp is great for data-structures, and that can be deferred a bit from initial learning. -- The main Bad Thing^TM about all of Forth, Lisp, and Python is that they're dynamically typed.

Not, in itself, a dealbreaker for me like weak-typing is... but I do prefer static typing. And it would be perhaps best to ingrain the notion of types (values+operations) in any introduction to programming class. -- As [John Carmack said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=00Q9-ftiPVQ#t=933):  
&gt; “How can you write a real program where you’re just assigning random shit to other shit and expecting it to work?”
