To add to that; 

[Enchanted Cave](http://www.kongregate.com/games/DustinAux/the-enchanted-cave), 

[One Chance](http://www.kongregate.com/games/LemmiBeans/one-chance), 

[Five](http://www.kongregate.com/games/z3lf/five) (Amazing soundtrack, wouldn't recommend at work), 

[Solipskier](http://www.kongregate.com/games/Mikengreg/solipskier) (Fucking amazing games! SOOOO GOOD! But you need music for it, sorry.), 

[SCGMD4](http://www.kongregate.com/games/sigames/scgmd4) (Guitar hero on keyboard, 3 was amazing as well (maybe even better)), 

[Race The Sun](http://www.kongregate.com/games/Flippfly/race-the-sun) (You can get full game on Steam, but the web version is still amazing), 

[The Last Stand Series (especially Union City)](http://www.kongregate.com/search?q=the+last+stand) (imo best web flash zombie game), 

[Epic Combo](http://www.kongregate.com/games/ArmorGames/epic-combo) and  [Mike Shadow: I paid for it!](http://www.kongregate.com/games/Tanoku/mike-shadow-i-paid-for-it?acomplete=mike+shado) (The two best combo games imo, Mike Shadow being the far superior while Epic Combo is one of the originals), 

[Upgrade COMPLETE! (Both of them)](http://www.kongregate.com/search?q=upgrade+complet) (A game whose gameplay is the upgrading system of games, you won't know how good it is until you try it), 

[Multitask 2](http://www.kongregate.com/games/IcyLime/multitask-2), 

[Infectonator](http://www.kongregate.com/games/TogeProductions/infectonator-2) (The series itself is great, it's one of the more popular flash games, or used to be), 

[Kingdom Rush](http://www.kongregate.com/games/Ironhidegames/kingdom-rush) (If you haven't played this... then my god, I think they went to mobile with this game simply because of how good it is. It's a tower defense, but it's an amazing one), 

[Gem Craft](http://www.kongregate.com/games/gameinabottle/gemcraft) (Another absolutely amazing TD game, not as pretty as KR, but really interesting), 

[Doodle God](http://www.kongregate.com/games/Badim/doodle-god),

[Red Remover](http://www.kongregate.com/games/TheGameHomepage/red-remover) (Puzzle game). 

Those were my favourites on Kongregate, and I'm not sure if that's all of them. I remember also playing SAS: Zombie assault, only not sure which one, there was also Learn to Fly, pretty fly game, but yeah, those are some of the best Kongregate games imo, used to play them all the time. Hope this helps!



EDIT: BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE! Some games from Newground I forgot; 

[Canabalt](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/510303) (The classic runner, I believe this is what inspired games like Robot Unicorn Attack IIRC), 

[Portal: The Flash Game](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/404612) (Trust me, if you liked Portal's gameplay, you're gonna love this. This is basically Portal but in 2D, truly amazing), 

[Sonny](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/417513) (The best RPG of web flash games, outstanding game!), 

[Thing Thing Arena 3](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/485863) (WARNING: Gory, this game was all the craze at high school, every body played this and I'm not exaggerating, it's just that good), 

[Road of the Dead](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/550714) (You drive, you run over zombies, over military and try to escape, what's not to love? Instead of gunning down the zombies you're running them down! Feels like 1998 game, but it's really good, 3D as well!), 

[Abobo's Great Adventure](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/587787) (Some people say this is the best flash game, some people are right. It is the single biggest old school nostalgia tribute in history of games), 

[Interactive Buddy](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/218014) (Such a fun and casual time killer, torture your buddy in more and more ridiculous ways and try to break the game (literally), 9.6/10, would recommend again), 

[Pandemic 2](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/448950) (You well fucking know what game this is!), 

[Dino run](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/443828) (Akin to Canabalt, it's a runner but a really, really fun one with unlock system and shit).

I think I'll leave it here, that should be enough to last you for a while and those are truly the pinnacles of web flash gaming. 

EDIT 2: Formatting changed thanks to /u/Gh0stTaco, if you could do upvote him for bringing up how much easier on eyes this format is! Thanks Taco! Regardless, I have remembered couple more MAJOR games that need to be played, some that have defined the flash games for me.

[Armed with Wings](http://www.armedwithwings.com/?page_id=22) (First game or two is REALLY weak, but as you progress in the series it becomes better, so much better, but do stick with the first one for the story, it's actually pretty damn good, so good I had to replay it. [IT HAS ITS OWN FUCKING WEBSITE AND A NEW SEQUEL WILL BE RELEASED ON STEAM!](http://www.armedwithwings.com/) That game was so good. I do question their web design... Looks off to me when you go on the flash pages.)

[Exit Path](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/538792) (MY FUCKING GOD! This one took me forever to find and it might very well be one of the best games ever made (imho), it's a running platformer but it's so goddamn well done and the story is so gripping (kind of like Portal without humour) that it is a must play. If you do play it, DO plau its sequel, because jesus mackerel, this game's a blast! 10/10, would recommend for eternity after!) 

[SHIFT](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/422855) (Oh boy, this is one of those games maaaaaan. Classic. Pure goddamn classic. It has I think 5 well deserved sequels, one of the best puzzle games out there!]

[How to Raise a Dragon](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/502747) (This one may seem weird, but trust me, it's really fucking good, it has tons of choices you can 
make and tons of endings, short game, but boy is it fun.)

[Bubble Tanks!](http://armorgames.com/play/58/bubble-tanks?via-search=1) (All of them! No questions asked! One of the best and most fun games out there!)

[Berzerk Ball (and it's sequel)](http://www.kongregate.com/games/JuicyBeast/burrito-bison?acomplete=bur) (Akin to Toss the Turtle, but imo better where instead of turtles or bisons, you smash 'nerds' as 'jocks' (I wasn't fan of Toss due to how grindy it felt, Bison imo was the better one))

On this note [Burrito Bison](http://www.kongregate.com/games/JuicyBeast/burrito-bison?acomplete=bur) (And its sequel) are one of the most fun toss games out there!

[Robot Dinosaur](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/490036) (You're a Dinosaur. That's a robot. That shoots lasers. And on top of that? It's in fucking Arcade style. One of the better honorable mentions.)

[Looming](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/541333) (By the same artist as the previous game, this one is more of 3deep5u type of game, it's not bad, it's actually great, really great, but the complexity of the story may seem a little forced.)

[Mega Miner](http://armorgames.com/play/12052/mega-miner) (A game about mining and it's really fun! It's the opposite of games like Kerbal since instead of trying to breach stratosphere, you're trying to drill into the earth's core! Really bloody fun.)

[Necrorun](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/563781) )Deserves a honorable mention, it's a really fun jousting game where you play as death in the medieval times, makes sure to check out its sequel if you enjoy they first one, IIRC they added a lot in the sequel.)

[Neon Rider](http://armorgames.com/play/5346/neon-rider) (Goddamn, it's not a popular game, but the concept was so much fun and it was so well done imo, definitely an honorable mention)

[Epic War 3](http://www.kongregate.com/games/rudy_sudarto/epic-war-3) (Holy goddamn fuck, that game was a classic! A strategy games where you send waves of your minions vs the enemy's. In my personal opinion, it was EW3 where it begun getting good, 4 was just PHENOMENAL but 5 I can't remember, if you don't enjoy 3 give 4 a god before you give up (unless you don't like the premise))

[Age of War](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/408209) (Similarly to Epic War 3 you send troops after troops with some timeline advances, it's not as good as most of the games on the list but definitely a honourable mention.)

[Rebuild](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/562116) (Oh boy, another Zombie game! Here you take a role as a survivor and in a style of City builder you try to rebuild civilization and defeat the plague! This and its sequel are really good.)

[Flight](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/559714) (Sweet game akin to Learn to Fly, except it's just imo sweeter in nature and prettier, might feel a bit grindier though.)

[Palading: The game](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/416507) That game was tons of fun, seem very generic so I have no idea why, but for some reason it worked! An honorable mention, definitely doesn't stand up to games like Exit Path or Armed with Wings.)


But seriously, those games? Fucking As, especially Exit Path and Armed with Wings. I give up, but I might come back again. Hope you enjoy spending the rest of your miserable life in front of a monitor because that's what's about to happen! It's a mix-match between recommended and honourable mentions since I was writing as I remembered the games.
