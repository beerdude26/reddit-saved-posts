Or grated.

Or wrapped in plastic.

Seriously the things we do to cheese, I just  don't think we deserve it.

**Edit:** *Getting a lot of comments so I'll use a ninja edit to go into detail.*

I'm a life-long cheese snob and worked for a couple of years as a cheesemonger at a specialty supermarket, which has only served to make me more pretentious. I may not be the foremost authority on all things curds but I'll happily share what I know because it makes me feel important.

When it comes to the proper care of cheese most of the damage is done on the retailer end attempting to comply with various health codes, consumer convenience, and even just making the product look appealing to customers. Here's some of the big bullet points:

* Cheese is best kept in large solid chunks (you know, the wheels they get shipped in.) In this state the cheese will keep longer and stay healthier than when portioned off into little chunks. The size of the wheel (or sometimes loaf) that the maker distributes it in is typically a good size for that particular type of cheese.
* The smaller the cheese is cut into the more air it gets exposed to the sooner it molds, this is why grated, shredded, and crumbled cheese can be considered to have a shorter shelf life because the smaller the piece the less salvageable. [Thanks to /u/Tift for making the clarification.]
* Even when it molds the cheese is still good. If you have a block of cheese and you see some mold growing on one end, just cut the moldy part off and you should still be good to go. Cheese is only "bad" when it spoils, as soon as the cheese tastes like spoiled milk kick it in the bin. Mold however does mean the end of shredded and grated cheese as there is no controlling for the spread of mold in that small a surface area.
* Some mold is good for cheese: Brie and other some other soft-ripened cheeses are covered in a soft white mold that protects the cheese within and is very tasty along with it. Blue cheese is named after the veins of blue mold (sometimes green, sometimes grey) that is within it.
* Cheese is alive, it's full of bacteria and is developing in flavor even as it sits in your fridge or on your counter. However the bacteria that are making the cheese so tasty are releasing gases that need to be let out, this is why wrapping it in plastic can harm the cheese. If you do wrap in it plastic let it breath every so often (once a week if you're keeping it that long.)
* The bacteria actually feeds the mold that eventually grows on your cheese, while the mold isn't edible (unless it's intentionally put there; see Soft-Ripened and Blue) it is considered a sign of a healthy cheese. Those big wheels of Parmesan will sometimes arrive at the store you buy it from covered in mold that the cheesemongers will carefully clean off.

**Tips for keeping and caring for cheese**

Most of you won't keep your cheese too long so some of these tips aren't necessary. However if you have a problem with cheese going wrong here's some tips for their upkeep.

1. Try and keep as much of the cheese intact as possible, the smaller the piece the harder to maintain the shorter the shelf-life.
2. Don't mind the mold, just cut it off as soon as you see it.
3. Avoid wrapping it plastic, cellophane (clingfilm) can suffocate the cheese causing it to spoil. Before that however you'll notice the area touching the plastic will have a greasy, duller flavor to it; this is the result of the bacterias gases not being able to escape and interacting with the plastic. Invest in some [cheesecloth](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#safe=off&amp;q=cheesecloth) instead. (A few other commenters have mentioned ziploc bags, which isn't a terrible idea provided they leave the bag just a little open.)
4. Try not to keep it under lights as this could dry out the cheese (since most of you will be keeping it in the fridge this isn't a threat.) If you do get a part of the cheese that goes hard and dry though, just cut it off.
5. If the cheese comes with mold on it (i.e. Brie, Blue) keep it separately from other cheeses and clean off surfaces and utensils after working with those cheeses. The mold can stick around and get on your other cheeses (and foods) ruining your day and giving you a hell of a cleaning job.


**Tips for serving cheese**
This is the fun part, want to impress your friends with cheese platter done right? Here's some pointers:

1. While best kept in a cool or cold environment most cheeses taste best at room temperature. Let it sit out on the counter for a while before serving it. Harder cheeses will start to look like they're sweating (like they know what's coming next) and softer cheeses will begin to melt (good Bries are virtually liquid at room temp.)
2. If doing a platter mix up the categories, Soft-ripened, Blue, Semi-firm, Cheddar, Alpine get a good mix in there. Don't be afraid to throw in some Goat and Sheep's milk if you get some. Your local cheesemonger will be able to give you some good recommendations on both variety, serving suggestions and pairings.
3. Pair the cheese with other foods. Some go better with Wine, some go better with Beer, some go great with Coffee. There's no hard and fast rules for paring cheese so take your time to research it.
4. There's no reason not to include flavored cheese (cheese with other ingredients added in; example: beer, jalepenos, onions/chives) just try not to let them too near any other cheeses as their flavors can easily taint the other cheeses. While you ideally will have a separate knife for each cheese on your platter, this is doubly true of flavored cheeses, it also goes for any Blues, Bries or other normally moldy cheeses on the platter if you think there'll be left overs.
5. If the rind is edible, eat it. Every time. Some cheeses have wax rinds, mesh rinds, foil rinds, and even rinds that are just hardened versions of the cheese; you can get rid of those. But the cheeses with softer rinds or mold rinds are edible. Some Blue cheeses are even wrapped in grape leaves; you should eat those.

**Edit Part Tres** A good comment reminded me about my favorite quote about cheese and imma share it here:
