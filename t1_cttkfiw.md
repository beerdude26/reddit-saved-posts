In the Flesh.

It's a fantastic, fairly short zombie series set in northern England, which is equal parts horror, exploration of humanity, and tragedy. It follows zombies who've been "cured" and rehabilitated into society, and their relationships and PTSD after the amost-apocalypse. 

Absolute must-see.
