(**EDIT**: Ty to everyone who read this. Thankyou for the thought provoking comments and clarifications on contrary evidence. My view point is entirely fluid and evolving and i am always adapting to new information, whether it be i learn of new historical events or alter errors when prevented with evidence. i have posted this elsewhere and it has never received much attention, so this really means alot that so many people found this information useful or helpful. Cheer's everyone :) Ty for the gold ) 

((**EDIT** this version has now been updated given the new information and feedback from the community. Thankyou everyone ))

Lets come to terms with the patterns that keep  repeating globally everyone.... 

What my investigations have lead me to believe is that Democracy is no longer practised on the planet. It was practised previously but was quickly subverted and corrupted. It is a ruse. A clever system of control that give the people the illusion of freedom. “None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free”. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

What we live in, is a plutocracy. Run by an oligarchy.

Who destroyed democracy. The most powerful people on the planet. Who are the most powerful people on the planet? Well Money is power so - The most absurdly rich people on the planet. The elites. It has been proven that over 99% of the worlds wealth is literally in the hands of 1% of the population on the planet.

We have been born into an age where an economic model is in place that is inherently designed to do one thing. To forever preserve and enlarge the power of the ruling class of the planet. This is done through the monetary system and achieved through using a debt based system of control known as central banking. Central banking is the concept of allowing a privately owned corporation to control a countries money supply under the justification that it will control inflation. 

The last 7 countries without a privately owned central bank that contains the usury principle (*the concept of interest) in 1999 were – Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Iran, North Korea, Cuba &amp; Sudan. Notice a pattern with those countries and the last few countries who have been invaded recently. Every country that has been invaded has had a new central bank installed. Now there are only 3 countries left in the world without a privately owned central bank.

The premise of a privately owned central bank is that it LOANS a country money, with INTEREST. It calls in this loan regularly. The problem is, a country was only given X amount. If it needs to pay X amount back plus the interest of Y, how on earth can it pay Y? By taking out another loan. This time the sum of X + Y. The process repeats and locks the country into a debt cycle. One which can never be escaped. The world is 40 trillion dollars in debt. In debt to who I ask you? It is in debt to a tiny handful of the richest people in the world who are all part of a banking cartel that has existed since the 1600’s. The Rothschild’s are the most prominent and well known. The Rockefeller’s are another.

**NOTE** 

Now it is at this point I always have someone point out their country is not under control of a private bank. Their banks is the official sounding “insert country name” central bank. Another point that is made at this stage, is the common notion that the structure of central banking has a mechanism that returns profits back into treasury of the nation’s money supply after covering the costs of maintaining the central bank itself. WHAT is not discussed on your first google hit of how central banks work, is the hidden notion of “covering costs” of running the central bank. Hidden in these costs, is the fee’s involved in being part of the IMF and the World Bank. These fee’s, are either subscription fees's or INTEREST depending on your role in the IMF.  To pay for this interest, you often must give them REAL ASSETS. Like GOLD. In essence, we are being bled of physical property and assets for using a FIAT CURRENCY. A currency worth NOTHING. Central Banks around the world are all connected to think tanks run by the wealthiest people on the planet. Furthermore, i have yet to find a central bank that has an EXTERNAL AUDIT PROCESS. Meaning you cannot see how much it costs to run the bank, the theory involved in their decisions or the people who they connected to globally which are wielding influence over their policy making decisions.

Here’s an expose of the history of the IMF and World Bank and its visible consequences that are being seen globally now.

Here is a series of graphs demonstrating america’s inflation levels before and after the inception of the federal reserve:

**END NOTE**


What happens when this process begins on a country. Privatisation. The countries resources that where once owned by the people progressively get sold off to attempt to pay this debt owed by using this privately controlled monetary system. 

The consequences of privatisation become more and more severe over time. Privatisation means it is a privately owned enterprise providing a service under the reasoning it will be a more efficient model. Only a select few profit from providing this service though. The number one rule for a corporation is increased revenue. Continually increased profit. If a company does not continue to generate more profit than the last year it is considered stagnating and will be replaced and bought out by a company that does. The by-product of perpetually increasing corporate profits is perpetually increasing prices. Thus the wealth gap in the world is ever increasing.

You can see the stages of privatising over a country in debt as it progressively loses its public assets. Telecommunications is one of the 1st to go. Then transportation. The process continues over every public property until it reaches the loss of the water supply. It is at this stage a country is in serious financial hardship and begins to sell its RESOURCES at undervalued rates to corporations. But we don’t notice the same people whom we must sell these assets and resources to are the same people who have indebted us in the first place by imposing the economic model we use.

We look around seeing its getting harder and harder to survive, our wages barely go up if ever and yet its getting more and more expensive to live. As seem in the graphs above, the wealth gap is becoming larger and larger and the richest people in the world are the only people experiencing a progressive gain in quality of life all whilst everybody else’s quality of life is diminishing.

We are strung along with this notion that if we work hard enough we can become just like them. Rich, Successful… Powerful. This is an illusion. A concept to justify the system and to encourage people to participate in it. The only people who come close are those that are pioneers of world changing technology’s (such as bill gates). Even bill gates, is nothing compared to the power of the elites. Bill gates is a billionaire. The elites are worth TRILLIONS.

Propaganda in its current state is a relatively new and incredibly powerful tool. It is subversive and ever present in our society. As shown in the study above all corporations are owned through share divisions by the same core group of wealthy elites. This includes the corporations that own the media. To influence human beings thought patterns, all it takes is repetition. You merely surround them with an idea or image or sound repetitively over and over again and a person assumes they came to this opinion themselves. “If I see it everywhere or if people keep saying it everywhere it must be true”. Never before in the history of humanity has manipulation of the populace been so easy. The saturation of television, internet and mobile devices coupled with the progressive science of psychology has led to a new era of propaganda that is on a massive, far reaching, intelligent &amp; psychologically manipulative scale that has never been seen before.

“If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.” Joseph Goebbels (Nazi Propaganda specialist)

Propaganda has taken on a new and even more insidious means of operation in this new technological era. It has recently been learned, through whistle-blower’s, that our governments around the world are currently engaged in social media manipulation on an unprecedented level. There is currently mass infiltration and manipulation of blogs, forums, social media outlets and popular sites which see mass level internet traffic by government agents. Yes this means facebook, reddit, tumblr… EVERYTHING. There is now divisions of government who’s sole purpose is to discredit activists and people talking about government crime. 


Let that sink in. There are now government agencies whose sole purpose is to manipulate social media through mass bot accounts and infiltration through positions of power of moderation, to take a thread and make it appear as if the majority of commentary and opinion in that thread is seen in a negative and derogatory light. To visit a thread or a page and see a heavily favoured view point already subconsciously alters your interest in the information presented in the thread or page. Sources here -

“Democracy is a con game. It’s a word invented to placate people to make them accept a given institution. All institutions sing, ‘We are free.’ The minute you hear ‘freedom’ and ‘democracy’, watch out… because in a truly free nation, no one has to tell you you’re free.” - Jacque Fresco

False flag attacks. Historical events in which a governing institution attacks itself in order to force its peoples to turn to the state to ask for assistance from an enemy, in the process giving up civil liberties and making the state more powerful. Also used as a pretext to sway public opinion into accepting their nation using imperialism to further its strength globally.

So, corporations are all owned by the wealthy elite. They have manipulated and subverted free societies into accepting economic models which are DESIGNED to enslave that nation into debt so that all resources and systems are under their control, even the system of how the nation is governed. Lobbyists spend billions  “persuading” our representatives to legislate the corporations ever increasing freedoms. All whilst our own personal liberties are being eroded.

These institutions were here before you were born. That’s why we think this is normal. “Its just business”, “Its just the way the world works”. This is not normal. This is not freedom. This is modern free range slavery delivered in such a subversive way that we cannot see our own prison. Yet we all know something is wrong. You just look around and you see it everywhere. Poverty. Starvation (All whilst current agricultural means are producing over 100% of the world’s food supply needs). War. ENDLESS war. In the entire time I have been alive I cannot remember a time where war was not being waged.
