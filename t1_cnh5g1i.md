I was doing that stumbleupon/page500+reddit/bored.com thing on Youtube right? Where you just wander aimlessly through videos in the "related" bit on the end?

I ended up on a video of a woman in a sports bra/thong/high heels crushing melons with her thighs and it was the sexiest thing that ever made me tilt my head and say "what?"

[This was the original I found.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6ykyr6Eh9M)

[This was a followup where she moans for a solid minute after popping the melon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OoT0SAH-qM)

Also, the myriad of "sexy girls + hula hoop" videos like [this.](http://vimeo.com/42206535)
