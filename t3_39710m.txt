title: Are there "themes" for Hakyll?
url: https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/39710m/are_there_themes_for_hakyll/

Static site generators like Jekyll and Pelican have databases of themes:

- http://jekyllthemes.org/
- http://pelicanthemes.com/

I've seen the "examples" for Hakyll at http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/examples.html, but I'm wondering if there are any general-purpose themes/templates anywhere.
