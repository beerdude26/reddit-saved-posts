Check out the Jenkinsverse especially. I found that a while ago and it's incredible.

For those who don't know, the premise is that Earth is considered a class 12 planet, where 1 is a dream world and 14 is inhospitable to all life. No sentient life can evolve in class 10 or higher, and yet here humans are. What seems to us like normal conditions would rapidly kill most galactic life, and so we are super beings amongst the other intelligent civilisations. Naturally, they're afraid of us and take some drastic measures to stop us before we acquire FTL.

So named because the very first story featured a character called Kevin Jenkins.
