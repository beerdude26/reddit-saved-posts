Not PM_ME but there are a few resources out there with a lot of value. Often instead of OOP you see people talking about ADTs instead (which are similar). Jeremy Gibbons' [*Unfolding Abstract Data Types*](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/adt.pdf) is one of my favorites.

PM_ME's suggestion to read Jacobs is pretty great as well. I also recommend, if you don't mind a funny little math book, Barwise and Moss' [*Vicious Circles*](http://www.amazon.com/Vicious-Circles-Center-Language-Information/dp/1575860082). I think I also recommend it just due to the (creepy) cover art.

No, I'm kidding, it's a good book.
