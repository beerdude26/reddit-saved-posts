Hello. 

I've got a few TB of data stored on my computer, network drive and some external drives. Problem is it's all over the place. I have loads of duplicate photos and files etc. I have no idea on file structure either. 

I work with photography so most of the data is .RAW and .Tiff files along with several thousand Jpegs from when I first picked up the camera. 

I need help/advice on how to sort the clutter out. My main issue is that I don't want to disturb the file structure of my light-room storage folders. And I want stuff kept simple. 

Anyone able to offer some advice?
