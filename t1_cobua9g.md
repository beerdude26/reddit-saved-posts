And there you have the heart of libertarianism.  They have deluded themselves into believing that they are smarter, more aware, and better equipped to survive in a world with the fewest rules possible.

The poor ones think the only reason they are poor is because society provides too much help to people that are dumb and lazy.  That in a truly level playing field, they would inevitably rise to the top.

The better off ones are convinced that they would have become wealthy no matter what and they would have even more if the government wasn't stealing their wealth and giving it to people too lazy and dumb to work hard like they did.
