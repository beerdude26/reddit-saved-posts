CircuitHub is a place where engineers can upload their hardware design and turn it into a prototype or a product at the click of a button. The company is growing fast, counts many household names as customers and is backed by Google Ventures as well as Y Combinator.

We’re a tight-knit team, working remotely from multiple places around the world - currently London, South Africa and California. Our year is interspersed with regular retreats to (preferably exotic) locations to brainstorm on the product and direction of the company.

Our business model is founded on providing end-to-end automation along with an amazing user experience for our customers. To this end we emphasize a safe, maintainable code base that can be refactored quickly and easily in order to optimize daily operations. With this in mind we’ve made the switch from NodeJS to Haskell for almost all new software development. In a similar vein we are currently using Elm together with AngularJS and have already started to publish a couple of small open source packages.
