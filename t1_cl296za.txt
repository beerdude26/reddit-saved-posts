I'm not very good at reviewing stuff, but I'll try my best. :D

Concerning the build quality, I thought it was impressive for the price I paid. The back was really soft and felt strong. (The deep purple color was really nice and all the girls loved it, ha.) The whole phone was maybe a little bit thicker than other phones in the same price range, but it was pretty lightweight (for me at least). The power button was maybe a bit hard to press down, but you get used to it.

I paid something like 130$ for it, and for that price I couldn't be happier. The phone was fast, smooth, and could handle a lot of stuff. The 4GB of ROM were not really enough though, but if you get an SD card and install link2SD (guides everywhere on how to do it properly) it would be fine. 

As for the battery life, it would last at least 2 whole days without having to charge it again. And I would be on Messenger and Whatsapp quite a lot. Good battery life.

I didn't keep the original OS for very long, because it had a lot of chinese stuff and wasn't that fast. I installed Lambda Rom on it and that made it much better.

The only thing I didn't like was that I couldn't get Android 4.4 on it.

I didn't really want to make a new post, it's quite an old phone and don't know if many people would still be interested haha.

I now have a 1+1, and it's amazing.
