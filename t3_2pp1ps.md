title: Are there any features like FP Complete's type inference popups in other Haskell IDEs?

In the FP Complete online IDE, if you select an expression in your code, the IDE will give you a small popup window with its type.

I've found this really convinient when dealing with sometimes uninutitive GHC type errors -- you can start small, then select larger and larger expressions to get their types and see exactly where your logic went wrong.

Are there any other Haskell IDEs (or Emacs, Yi extensions, etc...) that do this, or something similar right now? FP Complete is nice, but (at least in the free version, as far as I know), you can't always use all the packages you might need for a project.
