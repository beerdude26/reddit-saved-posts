Hi Timothy,

I’m xxxxx from Facebook’s recruiting team. I found your profile on Github and Haskellers and think that you could be a great match for Facebook.

We are currently looking for Senior Software Engineers to join our London office and work on products such as Search, Mobile Engineering, Developer Platform, Security, Site Integrity, etc.

Your passion for Haskell really caught my attention :)

Would you be interested in having a conversation about the opportunities at Facebook London that might be of interest to you?

If you are interested, let me know a day/time that suits and we can organise a time to talk.

Thanks,
xxxxx

==================

The funny thing, is I got an almost identical email from google a while back.  These are all sent out as template letters.

Actually, I think that this isn't a great thing.  This is zero barrier recruting.  They didn't look at my code and chances are they'd stop being interested the second they saw my resume. I don't yet have enough experience working in a group to work as a senior engineer. I have about 12 hours work experience.  It doesn't cost them anything to send out these emails en-mass.  But it probably costs a lot of young developers time and stress trying to respond to them only to find later that the interest wasn't meant seriously.
