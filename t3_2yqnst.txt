Now that I've been using Haskell for almost a year I find going back to imperative languages incredibly frustrating. I went and brushed up on my Python and the biggest problem I had with it was how verbose it is (which frustrated me more than the lack of compile time optimisation or type safety...).

For various reasons I'm finding JavaScript to be quite nice. The syntax is reasonably lean, there are higher order functions and I can take lessons from Haskell about mutable state. Duck Typing is annoying, as is the lack of compile time assurance and the largely poor performance. I certainly wouldn't do anything more than client side functionality for web.

I realise that what I'm really liking about Haskell more than anything is how terse it is. Once you understand the syntax it's not just quick to write but it's easy to understand.

I've seen a bit of J around and it looks like it might push that a bit far. Anyone have any experience with it? Once you understand the syntax is it possible to decipher what someone else's code means or is it a "write only language"?

What imperative languages do Haskellers out there like?
