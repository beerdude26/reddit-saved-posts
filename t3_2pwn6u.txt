title: Gave my talk on an introduction functional programming with Haskell

I gave my talk and the turnout was a bit disappointing. Only 6 people showed up, but it was still a good experience overall and a great way to ease myself into giving these kinds of talks. Plus, I have learned that scheduling a programming talk at 4pm on the Friday before Thanksgiving break is a bad idea if you want people to show up!

Extra special thanks to /u/tactics and /u/5outh (whom I shamelessly stole some slides from. They were just too good!) for their suggestions of what to cover in the talk in my [post asking for help](http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/2gb7y7/topics_to_cover_in_an_introduction_to_functional/).

I will be giving the talk again some time in the spring and used the feedback from the audience and the experience of talking to improve my slides a bit more, but I would love to hear what you guys think I should add, remove, clarify, or whatever. You can check it out [here on my website](http://malachi-thomas.com/fistful-of-functions/fistfuloffunctions.html).

It was definitely a great experience and I couldn't have done it without all of you guys!
