If you liked that comment you should check out a cool podcast called [*A Way With Words*](http://www.waywordradio.org/). A linguist and a dictionary editor talk about the origins and usage of words and phrases. It sounds dry as dust but it's really interesting. It's a call in show and the hosts are astonishing in their knowledge. 

They make a topic that by all rights should be boring into something quite entertaining.
