# Hey everyone!

/u/SyNiK4L and I have been working on some pretty big changes in [Muximux](https://github.com/mescon/Muximux) ^((a webbased portal to manage your different applications, such as NZBGet, CouchPotato, Pydio and whatever else you use)) that we are pleased to release after 10 days of code-crunching. More updates will follow, but we felt that the changes we've made so far are big enough, and stable enough to release as version 1.0.

### How to install
If you already have Muximux installed via git, you can just go to your Muximux-directory in your terminal and type ``git pull`` and you're done.

If you installed by downloading the ZIP-file, you can do that again and just overwrite everything, or better yet, save your config.ini.php file somewhere safe, empty the Muximux directory and re-download the zip and move your config.ini.php file back in.

Please note that we will *not* read your config.ini.php - instead, we will give you a dropdown showing you your old config. But do not distress, because your new configuration will be REALLY easy to make, because it's all in our new shiny Settings menu["Settings menu"](https://i.imgur.com/KsuOzH1.jpg)!

For full setup instructions, [read here](https://github.com/mescon/Muximux#setup).

### Make sure that...
* ... the directory you are serving Muximux from is [writeable by your webserver user](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+make+a+directory+writable+by+my+webserver).
* ... you have secured Muximux with [Basic Auth](https://github.com/mescon/Muximux#security) or other means.

### Major new features since first version
* Add, remove and rearrange your owns apps without touching any code - it's all in the settings menu!
* See what new updates are available for Muximux right from the Settings menu
* A shiny new dropdown menu (top right) where you can put items you don't use that often!
* Change or replace icons by just clicking the icon you think looks good.
* Enable or disable a landingpage for each app (landingpages prevent you from being bombarded with login-prompts, and reduces load on your browser).
* All menu items move to the dropdown when you access Muximux from your mobile phone or tablet!
* Refresh button - when you click it, only the app you are looking at will be reloaded - not EVERY app inside your browser. You can also double click the item in the menu.

### Behind the scenes features
* Deferred loading of apps - each app only opens when you first click it. Loading time of Muximux is very fast!
* Security token generated on each page load. To execute specific functions of Muximux you can not do it without this token - a token that changes when the user leaves the page, effectively making commands to Muximux not function if you are not a valid user of the Muximux app currently browsing it.
* API calls to Github to look up commit history/changelog are cached and only called *once* when Muximux is loaded.
* No HTTP requests to external servers. *Muximux fonts, icons and other resources: Google, Bootstrap, jQuery and Font-Awesome do not need to know you are hosting a server!*
* Custom versions of minified javascript libraries that removes some of the unnecessary functions we're not using, which result in less javascript overhead and faster loading times.
