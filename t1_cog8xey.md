I actually make an old family recipe for mashed potato salad all the time and none of the friends I've made it for have complained. In fact they all want it themselves
It's mashed potatoes, mayo, mustard, boiled eggs, caramelized onions and celery with onion powder salt and pepper to taste.


EDIT: since a couple people asked here's the recipe taken from another comment I made

I make the potatoes (I have a big family so it's usually a whole 5lb bag) Then I add in some margarine, salt, and black pepper. And mash them (I don't care for lumps but mash as you like) Then I take about two big serving spoons (so probably about 1/2 a cup?) Of mayo and stir it all in then the mustard just regular yellow I put in enough that it's a bright yellow. Then I take about 8-10 eggs and chop them first quarter them length ways and twice across and mix them and a couple caramelized onions and maybe 3-4 stalks of celery

In my house it's a regular side to meatloaf
